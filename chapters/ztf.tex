The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a wide-field optical survey telescope located at Mount Palomar in California, US at 1700 m above sea level. The housing, the 1.22 m (48 inch) Samuel Oschin telescope is a Schmidt design and was inaugurated in 1948. Originally, the telescope used photographic plates. In the early 2000s, the photographic plates were replaced by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera for the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program. This was succeeded

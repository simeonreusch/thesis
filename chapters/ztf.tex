\chapter{The Zwicky Transient Facility}
\labch{ZTF}
The second instrument relevant for this thesis is the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). It is named after the notorious Swiss-American astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who e.g. first employed the Virial theorem to infer the existence of dark matter \sidecite{Zwicky1933}. Furthermore, together with Walter Baade, he posited the existence of supernovae and the creation of neutron stars in such events \sidecite{Baade1934}.

ZTF is a wide-field optical survey telescope located at Mount Palomar in California, United States, at 1700 m above sea level. The housing, the 1.2 m (48 inch) Samuel Oschin telescope, is a Schmidt design and was inaugurated in 1948 \cite{Harrington1952}. Originally, the telescope used photographic plates. As these have obvious drawbacks, and because technological progress made it possible, the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program \sidecite{Pravdo1999} replaced the photographic plates with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera in the early 2000s.\marginnote{See \url{https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html} for a historical overview.}

The camera was updated several times over the course of the next years. The immediate predecessor of ZTF, the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) \sidecite{Law2009}, began operation in 2009. Equipped with a 96 Megapixel camera, it already had many of the characteristics of ZTF: A fully automated survey, searching for optical transients.

PTF's successor in spirit, ZTF, was the first electronic camera covering almost the full field of view (FOV) of the P48. The main design metric for ZTF was \textit{volumentric survey speed} \sidecite{Bellm2016}. This is the volume within which an object of given absolute magnitude can be detected in one exposure, divided by the total time for the exposure (observation plus overhead). The system saw first light in 2017, and started its scientific use in the year after. As of writing, it is still operational.

The two other telescopes located on Mount Palomar. The 1.5 m (60 inch) P60 telescope houses the SED Machine (SEDM) \sidecite{Blagorodnova2018}, a fully robotic, low-resolution spectrograph used for automatic classification of transients. The largest facility on the mountain is the 200-inch (5.1 m) Hale Telescope, which is used for optical and infrared photometry as well as mid- and high-resolution spectroscopy of fainter sources. Together, these telescopes form a natural hierarchy: ZTF is the discovery engine for optical transients. Promising sources are then classified with SEDM. If sources warrant it, deeper photometry and higher resolved spectroscopy can then be obtained with the big gun, the P200. All three telescopes are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:palomar_overview}.

\section{Telescope Design}
A Schmidt telescope is by design dedicated to taking images, contrary to earlier designs allowing actually looking through an eyepiece \sidecite{Schmidt1938}. The design goal is a wide field of view, ideal for sky surveys. It combines a spherical mirror at the end with an aspherical correcting lens (Schmidt plate) at the telescope entrance. The use of a spherical mirror combined with the correcting lens gets entirely rid of comatic aberration. Until the end of the 20th century, around ten Schmidt telescopes have been built, most of them to conduct sky surveys \sidecite{Cannon1995}. At least two of them were space telescopes: ESA's astrometry mission \textit{HIPPARCOS} \sidecite{ESA1997} (1989--1993) and the NASA explanet mission \textit{Kepler} \sidecite{Koch2010} (2009--2018). \todo{motivate their design as survey telescopes}.

\section{Camera}
Necessitated by the Schmidt design, the ZTF camera needed to be spherical, matching the spherical mirror.

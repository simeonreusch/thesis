\chapter{The Zwicky Transient Facility}
\labch{ZTF}
The second instrument relevant for this thesis is the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). It is named after the notorious Swiss-American astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who e.g. first employed the Virial theorem to infer the existence of dark matter \sidecite{Zwicky1933}. Furthermore, together with Walter Baade, he posited the existence of supernovae and the creation of neutron stars in such events \sidecite{Baade1934}.

ZTF is a wide-field optical survey telescope. This means that it normally operates by scanning the full sky with a fixed cadence, in contrast to pointing to specific objects. It is located at Mount Palomar in California, United States, at 1700 m above sea level, roughly 130 km southeast of Los Angeles. Its optical system, the 1.2 m (48 inch) Samuel Oschin telescope, is a Schmidt design (see below) and was inaugurated in 1948 \cite{Harrington1952}. At the time of inauguration and for years to come, it was the largest Schmidt telescope in the world. Originally, the telescope used photographic plates, covering a field of view (FoV) of 44 square degrees. As these have obvious drawbacks, and because technological progress made it possible, the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program \sidecite{Pravdo1999} replaced the photographic plates with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera in the early 2000s.\marginnote{See \url{https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html} for a historical overview.}

The camera was updated several times over the course of the next years. The immediate predecessor of ZTF, the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) \sidecite{Law2009}, began operation in 2009. Equipped with a 96 Megapixel camera, it already had many of the characteristics of ZTF: A fully automated survey, searching for optical transients with a CCD camera.

PTF's successor in spirit, ZTF, contains the first electronic camera. With 47 square degrees, it covers almost the full FoV of the P48. The main design metric for ZTF was \textit{volumentric survey speed} \sidecite{Bellm2016}. This is the volume within which an object of given absolute magnitude can be detected in one exposure, divided by the total time for the exposure (observation plus overhead). The system saw first light in 2017, and started its scientific use in the year after. As of writing, it is still operational.

The two other telescopes located on Mount Palomar. The 1.5 m (60 inch) P60 telescope houses the SED Machine (SEDM) \sidecite{Blagorodnova2018}, a fully robotic, low-resolution spectrograph used for automatic classification of transients. The largest facility on the mountain is the 200-inch (5.1 m) Hale Telescope, which is used for optical and infrared photometry as well as mid- and high-resolution spectroscopy of fainter sources. Together, these telescopes form a natural hierarchy: ZTF is the discovery engine for optical transients. Promising sources are then classified with SEDM. If sources warrant it, deeper photometry and higher resolved spectroscopy can then be obtained with the big gun, the P200. All three telescopes are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:palomar_overview}.

\section{Telescope Design}
A \textit{Schmidt telescope} is by design dedicated to taking images, contrary to earlier designs allowing actually looking through an eyepiece \sidecite{Schmidt1938}. For this reason, it is also referred to as a \textit{Schmidt camera}. The design goal is a wide FoV. This makes it the ideal instrument for sky surveys, where a large FoV maximizes the on-sky area that can be monitored. A Schmidt telescope combines a spherical mirror at the end of the telescope tube with an aspherical correcting lens (Schmidt plate) at the tube's entrance. The use of a spherical mirror combined with the correcting lens gets entirely rid of comatic aberration. Until the end of the 20th century, around ten Schmidt telescopes have been built, most of them to conduct sky surveys \sidecite{Cannon1995}. At least two of them were space telescopes: ESA's astrometry mission \textit{HIPPARCOS} \sidecite{ESA1997} (1989--1993) and the NASA explanet mission \textit{Kepler} \sidecite{Koch2010} (2009--2018). In both cases, the mission entailed monitoring of large areas of the sky; prime territory for Schmidt telescopes.

\section{Camera}
The ZTF camera is a CCD design, consisting of 16 individual CCDs by commercial manufacturer e2v (Science CCD231-C6), each having 6144x6160 pixels  \sidecite{Dekany2016}. As one can see in Fig. \ref{fig:ztf_camera}, the array of 16 CCDs is slightly bent. This is necessitated by the Schmidt design, 
where the camera needs to be spherical, matching the spherical mirror.

CCDs

An additional four smaller CCDs (2k x 2k pixels) are used guide and focus sensors.

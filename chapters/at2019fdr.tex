\chapter{Candidate TDE \emph{AT2019fdr}: A Possible Source?}\label{at2019fdr}
\labch{AT2019fdr}
\emph{AT2019fdr} emerged as a candidate when following up the high-energy IceCube neutrino \emph{IC200530A}. The gold alert\sidenote{See Section~\ref{ic_event_selection}} neutrino was detected on May 30, 2020 with a \SI{90}{\percent} rectangular uncertainty area of \SI{25.4}{\square\deg}, a signalness of 0.59 and an estimated neutrino energy of \SI{82.2}{\tera\eV}~\cite{IC200530A1}.

Two more sources were inititally published by us as candidate sources (SN2020lls and SN2020lam), but both could be ruled out with follow-up observations. For details on these, see Section~\ref{SN2020lls} and~\ref{SN2020lam}. This left \emph{AT2019fdr} as the only remaining neutrino source candidate, a long lived optical transient located at RA $= 257.278575$ and Dec $= +26.855758$, with a distance to the reported neutrino best-fit location of \SI{1.72}{\degree}.

At the moment of neutrino arrival, the transient was \textbf{already 400 days old}. It was originally discovered May 13, 2019 by \texttt{AMPEL}~\sidecite{at2019fdr_disc}, with a first detection on May 3, 2019. The neutrino arrived about \textbf{10 months after the optical peak}. The peak flux in the ZTF \textit{g}-band was \SI{1.3e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. The redshift of $z=0.2666$ was inferred from the Balmer lines visible in a spectrum taken on July 3, 2019 with the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the P200. The peak \textit{g}-band luminosity calculated with this redshift, $L_\text{peak}=\SI{2.9e44}{\erg\per\s}$, showed that \emph{AT2019fdr} was an \textbf{extraordinarily luminous event}\sidenote{Here and in the following standard flat cosmology will be used, with $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$ and $H_0=\SI{70}{\km\per\s\per\mega\parsec}$.}.

The long-duration flare was initially tentatively classified as a superluminous supernova of type IIn (SLSN IIn). A peculiarity of this event is that it occured close to the core of its host galaxy SDSSCGB 6856.2, a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy, a type of AGN (see Section~\ref{agn}). The mean angular separation to the host position as reported in the \textit{Gaia} DR2 was \num{0.03 \pm0.15} arcsec. Due to this proximity, it was systematically followed up by ZTF program dedicated to study flares in NLSy1 galaxies~\sidecite{Frederick2021}. 

In a paper describing the sample of such flares detected during ZTF Phase I, a \textbf{TDE interpretation} of \emph{AT2019fdr} was stipulated~\cite{Frederick2021}. The authors outright rejected a SLSN interpretation, and also argued against an AGN origin of the flare. The reasons for disfavoring the SLN hypothesis were the \textbf{long-lived U-band and UV emission}, \textbf{emission at the blue end of the Balmer line profiles}, the \textbf{longevity of the flare} and its \textbf{nuclear location} close to the center of its host galaxy~\cite{Frederick2021}.

In the following, an overview will be given over the observations in different wavelengths, the reductions of the near infrared observations triggered by our group, the modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED), the interpretation of the delayed infrared signal as dust echo. This will be followed by a discussion of the TDE interpretation and the calculation of the chance of observing an event comparable to \emph{AT2019fdr} in temporal and spatial coincidence with a high-energy neutrino.

\section{Multi-wavelength Observations}
As \emph{AT2019fdr} was discovered close to the core of its host galaxy, it was followed up as part of regular ZTF TDE group activities from early on, including ToO observations by \textit{Swift} UVOT and XRT. 

After observing the neutrino, we triggered additional follow up with \textit{Swift} UVOT, requested multi-epoch near-infrared observations with the Wide Field Infrared Camera (WIRC)~\sidecite{Wilson2003} on the P200, and triggered multi-epoch radio observations with VLA. 

Furthermore, we analyzed data by the LAT~\cite{Atwood2009} aboard the \textit{Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope} (\textit{Fermi}), and investigated four epochs of observations by the Extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) telescope~\sidecite{Predehl2021} aboard the \textit{Spectrum Roentgen Gamma} (\textit{SRG})~\sidecite{Sunyaev2021} space mission. 

All detections and upper limits except for the radio data are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_light_curve}. As one can see, the flare was very long lived, with a moderately fast rise (\SI{\sim100}{\day} until optical peak), a short decay phase followed by a plateau, and lastly an exponential decay, apparently with a constant decay rate~\sidecite{Reusch2022}.

\subsection{Gamma-ray Limits}

\begin{marginfigure}

    \caption[The \textit{Fermi} satellite]{The \textit{Fermi} satellite. Image credit: NASA.}
    \labfig{fermi_satellite}
\end{marginfigure}

The details of the \textit{Fermi} LAT analysis were published in~\sidecite{Velzen2021}. The one year long time window analyzed for \emph{AT2019fdr} spanned from the first optical detection of the source on May 3, 2019, until the arrival of the neutrino on May 30, 2020.

No gamma-ray sources were detected significantly (\SI{\geq5}{\sigma}), neither new sources nor previously known sources from the 10 year \textit{Fermi} LAT Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL-DR2)~\sidecite{Abdollahi2020,Ballet2020}. The \SI{95}{\percent} CL upper limit derived for this time window within the energy bin of \SIrange{0.1}{800}{\giga\eV} is \SI{1e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. This upper limit was calculated by testing a point-source hypothesis at the location of \emph{AT2019fdr}, assuming a power-law spectrum of the form $\text{d}N/\text{d}E \propto E^{-\gamma}$, with a spectral index $\gamma=2$~\cite{Velzen2021}.

\subsection{X-ray Observations}\label{x_ray_obs}
The sky region of AT2019 was visited four times by \textit{SRG} with a six-month cadence. The first visit was March 13--14, 2020. Only on the third visit one year later the source was detected, which can be counted as evidence for \textbf{temporal evolution in X-ray wavelengths}. All measurements and the upper limits and detections derived from these are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_light_curve} and listed in Table~\ref{tab:at2019fdr_erosita}.

\end{table}

The single detection from March 11, 2021 revealed a \textbf{very soft thermal spectrum}. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:erosita_fit}, the best-fit blackbody temperature was \SI[parse-numbers = false]{56^{+32}_{-26}}{\eV}, with the errors being \SI{68}{\percent} for one parameter of interest. In the source rest frame, this measurement corresponds to a temperature of \SI[parse-numbers = false]{71^{+41}_{-33}}{\eV}. This renders the X-ray spectrum of \emph{AT2019fdr} one of the softest spectra of the TDEs discovered by \textit{SRG}/eROSITA so far~\sidecite{Sazonov2021}. 

The equivalent neutral hydrogen column density had a best-fit value of $\text{NH}=\SI[parse-numbers = false]{1.47^{+2.80}_{-1.25}\times10^{21}}{\per\square\cm}$. This is a measure of the amount of neutral hydrogen atoms along the line of sight to the source. That value is consistent --- within errors --- with the galactic value of $\text{NH}_\text{Gal} = \SI{0.40e21}{\per\square\cm}$. There is some degeneracy between the neutral hydrogen column density and the inferred blackbody temperature; this is usual for soft sources. However, with $T_\text{bb}=\SI{131}{\eV}$ at the \SI{95}{\percent} confidence level, the temperature upper bound is still fairly low~\cite{Reusch2022}.

\end{figure}

As noted above, \textit{Swift} XRT had already observed \emph{AT2019fdr} 14 times prior to the neutrino arrival~\cite{Frederick2021}. We requested a prompt ToO observation after the source emerged as a neutrino candidate, which was carried out on June 7, 2020 with a \SI{2000}{\s} exposure.

The data was reduced with the publicly available \texttt{Swift XRT data products generator}~\sidecite{Centre2020} in the energy range of \SIrange{0.3}{10}{\kilo\eV}. As all 14 observations prior to the neutrino arrival were non-detections, those were binned (total exposure: \SI{20700}{\s}) to compute a \SI{3}{\sigma} energy flux upper limit of \SI{1.4e-13}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. The upper flux limit for the post-neutrino observation was \SI{4.7e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. To convert photon counts to to energy flux, I employed the \texttt{HEASARC WebPIMMS} tool~\sidecite{Arida2020}. The blackbody temperature was set to the \SI{56}{\eV} measured by \textit{SRG}/eROSITA, and the best-fit neutral hydrogen column density from the same measurement was used~\cite{Reusch2022}.

\subsection{Optical/UV Observations}
The ZTF \textbf{optical observations} were processed with \texttt{fpbot} (see Section~\ref{fpbot}). The science-ready \textit{Swift} data was retrieved from the \textit{Swift} archive\sidenote{\url{https://www.swift.ac.uk/swift_portal}}. All exposures of individual epochs were co-added, and filtered to boost the signal-to-noise ratio with \texttt{uvotsim}, contained in \texttt{HEAsoft}\sidenote{\url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft}}. The brightness of the transient was measured using \texttt{uvotsource} of the same package. The aperture used was \num{3} arcsec, with a far bigger radius used for the background level extraction. We calibrated the photometry with files made available by September 2020 and employed the methods of~\sidecite{Breeveld2011} to convert the measured magnitudes to the AB system\sidenote{See Section~\ref{magnitudes}}. The extracted and converted magnitudes were then corrected by subtracting the synthetic host model described in Section~\ref{synthetic_host_model}.~\cite{Reusch2022}.

As the extraction of the infrared measurements was more involved due to the presence of host galaxy blending, this will be detailed in Section~\ref{nir_reductions} below.

\subsection{Radio Observations}
After the neutrino detection, we applied for Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) on the VLA. Three individual measurements were taken on July 3, September 13 and November 7, 2020. The first epoch was carried out in the \SIrange{2}{4}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{8}{12}{\giga\Hz}. In the subsequent epochs, we added the \SIrange{1}{2}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{4}{8}{\giga\Hz} bands. Delay, bandpass and flux calibration were performed on the source 3C 286, and the nearby source J1716+2152 was used for the complex gain calibration. For this, the VLA calibration pipeline in the Common Astrometry Software Application (CASA)~\sidecite{Bean2022} was used, and imaging was performed with the CASA task \texttt{tclean}. Finally, the target flux density was measured by fitting a point source in the image plane~\cite{Reusch2022}.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{at2019fdr/vla.jpg}
    \caption[VLA]{VLA in New Mexico. Image credit: NSF.}
    \labfig{vla}
\end{marginfigure}

\textbf{Flux from the source location was measured in all three epochs}. In all epochs, the flux density declined with higher frequencies. While epoch 1 and 2 showed no evolution in the \SIrange{4}{8}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{8}{12}{\giga\Hz} bands, the final epoch suggested reduced flux and subsequently a spectral steepening in these bands. Intensive testing revealed that the reduced flux was not intrinsic to the source, but rather significant atmospheric phase changes between the calibrator scans. This reduced the measured flux densities during epoch 3 due to decorrelation. As the source flux density was too low for self calibration, the effect could not be corrected for. We concluded that \textbf{no evidence for temporal evolution in the radio} can be found during the 5 months of observation. All measurements are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_radio} and listed in Table~\ref{tab:at2019fdr_radio}.

From~\cite{Reusch2022}.}
    \labfig{at2019fdr_radio}
\end{figure}

To compare to pre-flare host radio emission, we also obtained an \textbf{archival upper limit} from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS)~\sidecite{Lacy2020}. We exclusively used VLASS, as it is the only survey with sufficient sensitivity and angular resolution to probe \emph{AT2019fdr}. The quicklook continuum \texttt{fits} file for tile T17t23We was obtained from the archive\sidenote{\url{https://archive-new.nrao.edu/vlass/quicklook}}. The observation was carried out on November 25, 2017 in the \SIrange{2}{4}{\giga\Hz} band. At a significance level of \SI{3}{\sigma}, no emission from the source was detected. The local RMS noise was $\sigma=\SI{0.11}{\milli\jansky}/\text{beam}$, and the beam size was $\SI{2.46}{\arcsecond} \times \SI{2.28}{\arcsecond}$ at a position angle of \SI{-37}{\degree}. This results in an upper limit of \SI{0.32}{\milli\jansky}. A second VLASS observation was taken a few days prior to our second trigger epoch, but the resulting \SI{3}{\sigma} upper limit was less constraining (\SI{0.4}{\milli\jansky})~\cite{Reusch2022}.

\section{Near-infrared Observations}\label{nir_reductions}
After the detection of the neutrino, we triggered \textbf{near-infrared (NIR) observations} to extend the SED to longer wavelengths. We observed during 4 epochs with WIRC on the Palomar P200 in the \textit{J}-, \textit{H} and \textit{Ks}-band, centered on \SI{1.2}{\micro\m}, \SI{1.6}{\micro\m} and \SI{2.1}{\micro\m}. The dates of observations were July 1 and September 27, 2020, as well as February 2 and May 28, 2021. 

All WIRC measurements were reduced using a custom pipeline (see~\sidecite{De2020}), which performs flat fielding, background subtraction and fits an astrometric solution using \textit{Gaia} DR2. Subsequently, the individual images for each filter and epoch were stacked to increase signal-to-noise. The photometric zero-point calibration of the stacked images was achieved within the pipeline by comparison to the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)~\sidecite{Skrutskie2006}.

\subsection{\texttt{GALFIT} flux extractions}

As another galaxy lies close to \emph{AT2019fdr}'s host galaxy\todo{distance}, the \textbf{flux extraction was performed manually} with \texttt{GALFIT}~\sidecite{Peng2002}. This two-dimensional fitting algorithm allows to define different galactic types and components, as well as point sources, and simultaneously fit the science images with these source types. 

To improve precision, the point spread function\sidenote{See Section~\ref{psfphot}} of individual stacked images was first derived with \texttt{photutils}~\sidecite{Bradley2020}, a package for the Python astronomy toolkit \texttt{astropy}~\sidecite{PriceWhelan2022}. All stars within the surrounding of \emph{AT2019fdr} were selected for this. From this selection, a subset of stars neither too dim nor too bright were visually selected (see Fig.~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_nir_starselection} for an example). Using these stars, the PSF of the image was calculated.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
    \includegraphics{at2019fdr/P200_third_epoch_H_stargrid.pdf}
    \caption[P200 \textit{H}-band star selection]{Exemplary star selection to fit the PSF of the stacked P200/WIRC \textit{H}-band image from Februar 2, 2021. Each cutout comprises $80\times80$ pixels. As can be seen, some of the stars have neighboring stars. As this can hamper a clean extraction of the PSF, they were rejected. All stars included in the PSF extraction are marked with a red rectangle (star 0, 6 and 7). One can also see that during this epoch, observing conditions were not ideal, resulting in horicontally elongated images of the stars.}
    \labfig{at2019fdr_nir_starselection}
\end{figure*}

The stars were automatically retrieved with \texttt{DAOStarFinder}, while PSF fitting was performed with \texttt{EPSFBuilder}. The quality of the extracted PSF was verified by inspecting the residuals of 4 nearby reference stars from SDSS (see Fig~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_nir_teststar}). 

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{at2019fdr/H_3_teststar2.pdf}
    \caption[P200 \textit{H}-band reference star]{P200 \textit{H}-band reference star. The \texttt{GALFIT} point source model constructed from the image PSF (center) gets subtracted from the science image (left), the residual is shown on the right.}
    \labfig{at2019fdr_nir_teststar}
\end{figure}

The resulting PSF was then ingested into \texttt{GALFIT}. Two Sérsic  profiles describing the galaxy flux as a function of the distance to the galaxy core were then defined\sidenote{For details, see e.g.~\cite{Graham2005}.}, centered on the host and the neighboring galaxy location. Additionally, a point source with variable position was used. These were then fit together, resulting in \textbf{flux values for the host galaxy, the neighboring galaxy and the transient}.

All parameters except for the point source flux were fixed after fitting one epoch (reference epoch). The point source flux was then fit in the remaining three epochs. Unfortunately, the choice of reference epoch had an impact on the point source flux values. This can be explained by differing observing conditions at different epochs. To \textbf{account for this variation}, both epoch 1 and epoch 4 were used as reference epochs. The difference in the transient flux (when using epoch 1 as reference epoch, and when using epoch 4 as such) was taken as systematic uncertainty on the extracted transient flux~\cite{Reusch2022}.

As there was no image without transient flux available, we added the point source and the host galaxy flux, and then subtracted the synthetic host model\sidenote{See Section~\ref{synthetic_host_model}.}. The model-subtracted AB magnitudes calculated by this procedure are shown in Table~\ref{tab:p200_nir}.

\subsection{\textit{WISE} Detections}

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{at2019fdr/wise.jpg}
    \caption[The \textit{WISE} satellite]{The \textit{WISE} satellite. Image credit: NASA.}
    \labfig{wise}
\end{marginfigure}

Additionally to the ground-based NIR observations with P200, images from the \textbf{mid-infrared (MIR)} \textit{WISE} satellite were obtained in the \textit{W1}- and \textit{W2}-band (\SI{3.4}{\micro\m} and \SI{4.6}{\micro\m}).\ \textit{WISE} has cadence of 6 months, and the available images comprised \textbf{13 observational epochs prior} to the detection of \emph{AT2019fdr}, as well as \textbf{3 epochs during the transient's life}.

As the MIR photometry --- like the NIR photometry --- suffered from blending with the nearby galaxy, forced PSF photometry was used on the co-added images (done with \texttt{ICORE}~\sidecite{Masci2013}) of each observational epoch. The package employed for this was \texttt{PythonPhot}~\sidecite{Jones2015}, a Python adaptation of the \texttt{DaoPhot}~\cite{Stetson1987} algorithms. 

The root mean square (RMS) of the pre-flare datapoints was only \SI{18}{\micro\jansky}, which was significantly smaller than the peak difference flux, measured at \SI{0.9}{\milli\jansky}. A robust \textbf{baseline} can therefore be constructed from the pre-flare \textit{WISE} detections. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

From~\cite{Velzen2021}}
    \labfig{at2019fdr_wise}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Synthetic Host Model}\label{synthetic_host_model}
As not all measurements from the various instruments had the luxury of readily available reference images for easy extraction of transient light (as is e.g.\ the case for ZTF), we constructed a \textbf{synthetic model} of the emission from the host galaxy. 

This was done by fitting a galaxy model as described in~\sidecite{Velzen2020}, using different archival measurements: To measure the UV flux, we used images from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (\textit{GALEX})~\sidecite{Martin2005}. The \texttt{gPhoton}~\sidecite{Million2016} package with an aperture of \SI{4}{\arcsecond} was used for flux extraction.

To measure the optical flux, we employed the model magnitudes from SDSS. These are computed either from a de Vaucouleurs galaxy profile, or an exponential galaxy profile (the model mag uses the better of the two fits)\sidenote{See \url{https://www.sdss4.org/dr12/algorithms/magnitudes/mag_model} for details.}.

We also included the baseline \textit{WISE} datapoints detailed above, as well as an archival infrared measurement from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS)~\sidecite{Lawrence2007}. Then, the \texttt{prospector} toolkit~\sidecite{Johnson2021} was used to sample synthetic galaxy models built by Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (\texttt{FSPS})~\sidecite{Conroy2010}, written in Fortran and employed via the Python wrapper \texttt{python-fsps}~\sidecite{ForemanMackey2014}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \caption[Synthetic host spectrum]{Synthetic host spectrum constructed with \texttt{FSPS}. Figure by S. van Velzen, annotations by the author.}
    \labfig{host_model}
\end{figure}

The host model was subsequently subtracted from all measurements possibly containing host light within their respective bandpass using \texttt{SNCosmo}~\sidecite{Barbary2022}, a Python framework dedicated to supernova analysis.

\end{table}

\section{SED Blackbody Modeling}
After compiling and reducing the individual light curve measurements, a physical model motivating the detected light needed to be applied. 

To explain the SED, we experimented with different models, comprising a single blackbody, a power law, a broken power law\sidenote{I.e.\ a power law with a break at a certain wavelength where the spectral index suddenly changes.} and two blackbodies. The \textbf{double blackbody model matched the observations best}. In the following, I will detail the derivation of this model and the energy output of the system derived from this, including a discussion of dust extinction.

\subsection{Fit Epochs}
First, we isolated \textbf{three regions of interest}. These comprised (1) the 20 days between August 5 and 25, 2019, as this windows covers the optical peak of the light curve, as well as the first \textit{WISE} measurement. The second, longer epoch (2) ranged from June 6 to October 8, 2020 (124 days), shortly after the neutrino detection. It covers one \textit{WISE} measurement epoch and two P200 NIR observations. The last epoch (3) covered January 1 to February 26, 2021 (51 days) and contains another P200 NIR observation.

As the light curve does not significantly change during those epochs, we used the mean flux values for each observed bands as input for the fitting procedure.

\subsection{Fit Models}\label{fitmodels}
As stated above, we tried a variety of models:

\begin{description}
\item[Unbroken power law] A single, unbroken power law with the power law index as free parameter

\end{description}

All fits were performed with the \texttt{lmfit}~\sidecite{Newville2021} Python package, which implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for solving non-linear least-squares problems.

To account for \textbf{host extinction}, we used the \texttt{extinction}~\sidecite{Barbary2016} Python package, namely the Calzetti attenuation law~\sidecite{Calzetti2000} contained therein. We fixed the extinction $R_V$ at $3.1$ and left $A_V$ free in epoch 1. The best-fit value of $A_V=0.45^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ was fixed in epoch 2 and 3. We decided on using epoch 1 to determine $A_V$, as it provided the best optical and UV coverage of the three epochs. For the double blackbody model, this procedure ultimately resulted in 5 (4) free parameters in epoch 1 (2 and 3).

We imported the measurements, averaged each the flux in each band per epoch, and passed them to the minimizer (the fit priors are shown in Table~\ref{tab:double_bb_priors}).

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}

\hline

\caption[Double BB fit priors]{Priors for the double blackbody minimization. $A_V$ is the extinction parameter (only fitted in epoch 1 and fixed for epoch 2 and 3), $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the temperatures of the two blackbodies, while $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the `Scale' parameters (which can be converted into radii.)}\label{tab:double_bb_priors}
\end{table}

The model for the blackbodies was provided by \texttt{astropy}\sidenote{\texttt{astropy.modeling.models.BackbBody}}. As this model works with a \textit{scale} parameter\sidenote{This \texttt{astropy} terminology is slightly confusing, as the scale has units of spectral radiance (\unit{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm\per\Hz\per\steradian}).} instead of a blackbody radius, this needs to be converted via 

\begin{equation}
\text{Scale} = d_L^2 / (r^2 \pi)
\end{equation}

where $r$ is the blackbody radius and $d_L$ is the \textit{luminosity distance}, calculated with the redshift $z=0.2666$ and assuming a standard cosmology. The luminosity distance is a measure for how far away something `looks'. If the luminosity $L$ is the total amount of energy isotropically radiated by an object per unit time, it is related to the flux $F$ measured at luminosity distance $d_L$ via this relation, describing an expanding sphere of light:

\begin{equation}
d_L = \sqrt{L/4\pi F}
\end{equation}

The luminosity distance is equal to the proper distance (as in the amount of space a photon had to traverse to reach us) if and only if the universe is geometrically flat and the universe is static, so it is neither shrinking nor expanding. As the universe in fact \textit{is} expanding, the luminosity distance is similar to the proper distance only for small redshifts (i.e.\ if there was little time needed for the photon to reach us, and therefore little expansion). In general, the luminosity distance depends on the evolution of the universe. Here, the luminosity distance was calculated with the \texttt{astropy.cosmology} module. 

\subsection{Minimization}

    \labfig{at2019fdr_lightcurve_and_sed}
\end{figure*}

In each iteration of the minization proceess, the spectrum of both blackbodies constructed as such were then reddened, and redshifted. After this, the two blackbody spectra were added. 

To extract the flux as observed in each band, \texttt{SNCosmo} was used to evaluate all bands given their \textbf{transmission} function. For this, the integrated bandpass library of \texttt{SNCosmo} was used. Bandpasses that were not shipped with the package were added manually from the SVO Filter Profile Service~\sidecite{Rodrigo2020}. This was the case for \textit{Swift}, P200 and \textit{WISE}.

The best fit values from all three epochs, as well as their uncertainties (\SI{68}{\percent} uncertainty level) can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:double_bb}. The best-fit temperatures result in a \textbf{blue blackbody} peaking in optical/UV wavelengths, and a \textbf{red blackbody} peaking in the infrared.

We derived an optical/UV peak luminosity of $L=\SI[parse-numbers = false]{1.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\times10^{45}}{\erg\per\s}$. By integrating this component over time by scaling it with the shape of the ZTF \textit{g}-band light curve, we obtained a \textbf{total bolometric luminosity} of $E_\text{bol} = \SI{3.4e52}{\erg}$. We did not add the infrared blackbody, as dust absorption was already accounted for by fitting for dust extinction. This pushes \emph{AT2019fdr} to the class of \textbf{brightest transients ever detected}. Its inferred bolometric energy was almost twice as high as that of ASASSN-15lh, which was one of most luminous transients ever reported~\sidecite{Dong2016} and which was suggested to be a TDE~\sidecite{Leloudas2016}.

\end{table}


\subsection{Uncertainty Estimate}
As the fit routine was not able to generate stable covariance matrices in all epochs, the \textbf{uncertainties were estimated manually}.

For each epoch and fit parameter, this was done by letting all parameters very except for the parameter of interest. This parameter was then varied around the best-fit value, and the resulting $\chi^2$ was evaluated. The $\chi^2$ distribution was then approximated with a polynomial, and the the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence level calculated --- the two parameter values with $\chi^2 - \chi^2_\text{min} = 1$ confine the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence level.

From the fit parameter uncertainties calculated as such, the uncertainties on the radius and the luminosities was obtained via Gaussian error propagation.

This shows that they are pushing the temperature down.}\label{fig:at2019fdr_contour}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:double_bb}, the third epoch saw a temperature rise in the infrared blackbody. As these values were in tension with the dust-echo model discussed below\sidenote{See Section~\ref{dust_echo}.}, we investigated this behavior.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{at2019fdr/at2019fdr_bb_chisq.pdf}
    \caption[Uncertainty estimation for double BB fit]{Uncertainty estimation for the double blackbody fits. Here, the uncertainty of the temperature $T_1$ of the hot (`blue') blackbody during epoch 2 is estimated. The blue points show the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence level.}
    \labfig{bb_chisq}
\end{marginfigure}

The most likely reason for the higher temperature in epoch 3 is that the infrared blackbody was \textbf{less constrained in that epoch}, as there were no \textit{WISE} measurements available, and the P200 \textit{J}-band extraction resulted in a non-detection. In Fig.~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_contour_all}, one can see that all three epochs were compatible within their \SI{90}{\percent} confidence level with a blackbody temperature of \SI{1850}{\K}.


Furthermore, all epochs showed the \textbf{expected linear correlation} between increasing blackbody temperature and decreasing radius of the blackbody. Fig.~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_contour_all_nowise} shows how the \SI{90}{\percent} contour of epoch 2 gets moved to a higher temperature and lower radius when removing the two \textit{WISE} datapoints. This reinforces the case that the higher best-fit temperature in epoch 3 is merely an artifact of having less constraints for the fit and not some unexplained physical process.

\section{Dust Echo Model}\label{dust_echo}
As one can see in the light curve of \emph{AT2019fdr} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_light_curve}), the emission in all infrared bands (\textit{WISE} and P200) is \textbf{delayed with respect to the optical signal}. Furthermore, the infrared emission is well approximated by a blackbody, as was shown in the last section.

We interpret this infrared emission as a \textbf{dust echo}. In this model, the X-ray to optical light from the flare is reprocessed by dust. This dust is usually located in a torus around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the host galaxy~\sidecite{Velzen2016}. The high luminosity of the flare causes the dust in the vicinity of the black hole to evaporate, up to a safe distance, at which the incident flux heats the dust, but not above its sublimation temperature at around \SI{1850}{\K}.

Outside the sublimation radius, the grain temperature is coupled to the incident radiation, as it cools rapidly ($10^{-4} a_{0.1}^-1T_{1850}^{-5}$ s, which equals to \SI{0.1}{\milli\s} for a grain size of \SI{0.1}{\micro\m} at \SI{1850}{\K}).

The infrared light curve produced this way can be approximated as follows according to~\cite{Velzen2016}:

\begin{equation}
L_\text{IR} = \int d\tau~ \Psi(\tau) ~L(t-\tau)
\end{equation}
where $L(t)$ is the light curve of an isotropic flare,  $\Psi(\tau)$ is the response function and $\tau$ is the delay. In the case of a spherical dust shell, $\Psi(\tau)$ can be approximated by a square wave response function, ranging from $\tau=0$ to $\tau = 2 R_0 c$ (where $R_0$ is the radius of the dust shell). We can therefore write

\begin{equation}
L_\text{IR} = \int d\tau L (t-\tau) ~\Pi (\tau)
\end{equation}
 
The delay induced by light travel time can thus be approximated by \textbf{convolving the optical light curve with a box function} of width $2\times\Delta_{t_c}$, where $t_c$ is the light travel time from the transient to the surrounding dust sphere.

This can be understood if one looks at the geometry of the system. After a delay of $\Delta_{t_c}$, light from the flare reaches the inner edge of the sphere that survives the incident radiation, directly along our line of sight. Here it gets re-emitted in the infrared and reaches us with that initial delay of $cR_0$. Re-emitted light from the side of the system takes even longer. Lastly, re-emitted light from the back of the system reaches us with a delay of $3\times cR_0$ --- first the flare light needs to travel one radius away from us, and then the re-emitted light needs to cross the whole system (twice $R_0$) towards us.

To calculate $R_0$, we used the ZTF \textit{g}-band light curve, as it is the one with the best sampling. This light curve was then convolved with the box function, where the width of the box function in days was left as free parameter. The initial delay with respect to the optical light curve was then half the size of the box function. The second free parameter was a dimensionless amplitude used to scale the optical light curve to match the amplitude of the \textit{WISE} datapoints.

Following this procedure, we obtained a best-fit light travel time of 193 days, which translated to $R_0=\SI{0.16}{\parsec}$. The best fit parameters can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:at2019fdr_dust_model_chisq}.

To crosscheck this result, we used the fact that according to~\cite{Velzen2016}, the radius of this dust shell can be approximated as 
\begin{equation}
R= \bigg(\frac{L_{45}}{a_{0.1}^2 T_{1850}^{5.8}} \bigg)^{1/2} \text{pc}
\end{equation}
where $L_{45}$ is the flare's luminosity integrated over all wavelengths where the dust absorbs, normalized to \SI{1e45}{\erg\per\s}, $a_{0.1}$ is the dust grain size normalized to $\SI{0.1}{\micro\m}$, and $T_{1850}$ is the grain temperature normalized to \SI{1850}{\K}.

    \labfig{at2019fdr_dust_model_chisq}
\end{figure}

When inserting the infrared blackbody temperature from the second epoch (as it is the best constrained one) with a temperature of \SI{1762}{\K}, using the default grain size and the peak optical luminosity of \SI{1.4e45}{\erg\s}, this equation yields a sublimation radius of \SI{0.2}{\parsec}, which is in \textbf{good agreement} with the best-fit value of \SI{0.16}{\parsec}.

To obtain the \textbf{covering factor}, i.e.\ the fraction of the shell around the transient that actually contained dust, we needed to derive the total bolometric energy of the dust echo. This was achieved by time-integrating the fitted dust echo light curve, scaled to the peak luminosity of \SI{4.3e44}{\erg\s}. This resulted in a dust echo bolometric energy of \SI{1.1e45}{\erg}. The ratio of the the dust echo bolometric energy to the optical/UV bolometric energy yielded a covering factor of 1/3, which was unusually high (TDEs in quiescent galaxies usually have covering factors \SI{\sim1}{\percent}, see~\cite{Velzen2016}).

We used this covering factor and the radius of the dust shell to \textbf{determine the dust mass}. Again assuming a grain size of \SI{0.1}{\micro\m}, spherical dust grains and a typical dust mass density of \SI{2.5}{\g\per\cm} results in a mass of $0.017 ~\text{M}_\odot$ contributing to the echo. When assuming a typical mass-to-gas ratio of 1:100, this corresponds to $1.7 ~\text{M}_\odot$ in gas.

\section{Classification}
As stated at the beginning of this chapter, \emph{AT2019fdr} was initially classified as a SLSN IIn, but a subsequent paper classified \emph{AT2019fdr} as TDE~\cite{Frederick2021}. In this section I will present their reasoning, as well as further evidence we brought forward in favor of this hypothesis, but also some data weakening this interpretation.

\subsection{Original TDE Classification}
Frederick et al.~\cite{Frederick2021} outright rejected the SLSN IIn interpretation, but discussed that \emph{AT2019fdr} --- as all the 5 flares located in NLSy1 galaxies they studied --- could either be an AGN flare or a TDE. They based their classifications on a set of criteria, detailed in Table~\ref{tab:at2019fdr_classification_matrix}. The green cells in the table show that the feature being present (\checkmark) or absent ($\times$) makes a TDE interpretation more likely, while red color means that a flare origin is more likely.

Adapted from~\cite{Frederick2021}.}
\label{tab:at2019fdr_classification_matrix}
\end{table*}

In the case of \emph{AT2019fdr}, the host galaxy black hole mass lies below the Hills mass ($\lesssim 10^8 M_\odot$), it was persistently detected in UV around the peak, but initally not in X-ray wavelengths, its \textit{WISE} \textit{W1}-\textit{W2} color was below $0.7~\text{mag}$, and it showed no signs of rebrightening at the time of publication. 

On the other hand, its narrow H$_\beta$ emission feature and its [OIII]/H$_\beta$ flux ratio, the strong FeII complex and the transients lack of cooling rather stipulated a flare of the underlying NLSy1 host.

To conclude: \textbf{A thin majority of features observed in \emph{AT2019fdr} were `TDE-like'}. Also, it resembled \emph{PS1--10adi}, a bright transient discovered by PS1 on August 1, 2010~\sidecite{Kankare2017}, which has been classified as a TDE embedded in an AGN~\sidecite{Jiang2019}. For these reasons, the transient was ultimately classified as TDE. Following the subclassification scheme proposed in~\sidecite{Velzen2021a}, it is a H-only TDE, with the FeII complex most likely stemming from the NLSy1 host galaxy.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{at2019fdr/at2019fdr_lc_rebrightening.pdf}
    \caption[\emph{AT2019fdr} rebrightening]{\emph{AT2019fdr} late stage rebrightening. Starting around MJD $=59500$, the flux in all ZTF bands increased, until it reached a plateau $\sim 200$ days later.}
    \labfig{at2019fdr_rebrightening}
\end{figure}

After the publication of our paper on \emph{AT2019fdr}, the transient underwent a significant rebrightening in the optical. About 2.2 years after the optical peak and continuous decline ever since, the flux in all three ZTF bands started to increase again, until it hit a plateau roughly 200 days later. As of April 2023, \emph{AT2019fdr} is still in this plateau. This is atypical behavior for TDEs and SNe, as was already pointed out in~\cite{Frederick2021}. 

Interestingly, also \emph{PS1--10adi} showed late-stage rebrightening~\cite{Jiang2019}. For this transient, the authors discussed a variety of causes for this. They concluded that late-stage accretion was unlikely, based on the different properties of the dust echoes of the initial flare and the rebrightening. They also discard interaction between the debris and the SMBH torus, based on the fact that the complete conversion of the unbound debris' orbital energy was insufficient to explain the brightness of the rebrightening. Instead, they favor a scenario where a mildly relativistic outflow from the TDE is responsible for the rebrightening~\cite{Jiang2019}.

It remains an open question if the long-lasting rebrightening of \emph{AT2019fdr} can be explained by such an outflow. One could also hypothesize that a perturbation in the accretion disk, triggered by the TDE, is responsible for the increased optical flux (see e.g.~\sidecite{Ricci2022}).\todo{ask Walter or Sjoert}

\subsection{Additional Evidence}
As already discussed in Section~\ref{x_ray_obs}, \emph{AT2019fdr} was detected by \textit{SRG}/eROSITA on the first visit with an unusually soft thermal spectrum of \SI[parse-numbers = false]{56^{+32}_{-26}}{\eV}. As AGN X-ray spectra are \textbf{rarely soft}~\sidecite{Saxton2020}, this can be \textbf{counted as evidence in favor of the TDE interpration}.

NLSy1 galaxies in general exhibit softer spectra, the temperature of \emph{AT2019fdr} was atypically low also in this context: It was lower than all NLSy1 temperatures in~\sidecite{Leighly1999} and~\sidecite{Vaughan1999}. Additionally, SLSNe rarely emit X-ray radiation. Only the first SLSN ever detected, SCP 06F6~\sidecite{Barbary2008}, possibly showed an X-ray flux exceeding \emph{AT2019fdr}'s luminosity~\sidecite{Gaensicke2009}.

The dust echo (see Section~\ref{dust_echo}) we found, together with the energy budget and the bolometric evolution suggests that \emph{AT2019fdr} belongs into an emerging class of strong TDE candidates located in AGN, as e.g.\ \emph{PS1-10adi} (discussed above), \emph{AT2017gbl}~\sidecite{Kool2020}, or \emph{Arp 299-B AT1}~\sidecite{Mattila2018}.

\section{Chance Coincidence}
To compute the \textbf{chance coincidence} of observing a TDE comparable to \emph{AT2019fdr} in spatial and temporal coincidence with a high-energy neutrino, we created a sample of TDEs and candidate TDEs of comparable or higher brightness.

The sample from which these sources were selected was the full sample of nuclear transients as selected by a filter implemented in \texttt{AMPEL} (see Section~\ref{ampel}). This filter required at least 10 detections in both the \textit{g}- and the \textit{r}-band. Additionally, we required a weighted maximum distance of the flare to its host of $\leq \SI{0.5}{\arcsecond}$, and that most datapoints had positive flux after subtraction of the reference image. A detailed discussion of the nuclear filter applied will be provided in the next chapter.\todo{ref} 

We restricted the dataset to transients first detected after January 1, 2018 to ensure that all of them had high-quality reference images. We also required the transients to have peaked before July 2020; 3172 flare candidates remained after these cuts.

We further required that the transients were not classified as variable stars, or bogus objects. Additionally, their rise (fade) $e$-folding time was required to exceed the uncertainty on this parameter. At this stage, 1628 candidates remained.

As only candidates with brightness comparable to or higher than \emph{AT2019fdr} were of interest, we required their peak apparent magnitude to be $\leq$ \emph{AT2019fdr}'s peak apparent magnitude; this left 157 transients. To select candidate TDE and accretion flares, we required the rise (fade) $e$-folding time to lie in a [15,80] ([30,500]) day interval, which left 25 transients.

Lastly, we excluded those transients from the sample of 25 transients which were spectroscopically classified as supernovae, or were ruled out as short-timescale AGN variability by visual inspection. We also excluded candidates which displayed no consistent color or color evolution post peak, or which had a non-smooth light curve evolution post peak. This left a \textbf{final sample of 12 transients}. 

We then calculated the effective source density $\rho_\text{eff}$ --- i.e.\ the density of sources per \unit{\square\deg} of sky in the survey footprint at any given time --- as follows:

\begin{equation}
\rho_\text{eff} = (N_\text{flare} \times \Delta t_\text{flare}) / (A_\text{ZTF}  \times \Delta t_\text{search})
\end{equation}
where $N_\text{flare}$ is the total number of comparable sources (including \emph{AT2019dsg} and \emph{AT2019fdr}), $\Delta t_\text{flare}$ is the typical duration of such events, $A_\text{ZTF}$ is the sky area accessible to ZTF, excluding sources with a galactic latitude $|b|<\SI{7}{\degree}$, and $\Delta t_\text{search}$ is the time range of the sources sample, i.e.\ 2.5 years. With the 12 events of the comparison sample, the effective source density is $\rho_\text{eff} = \SI{1.71e-4}{\deg}^{-2}$.

Now an \textbf{expectation value for the number of neutrinos coincident with two sources} can be calculated as $\mu=\rho_\text{eff}\times A_\text{IC}$, where $A_\text{IC}$ is the summed \SI{90}{\percent} uncertainty area of the alert neutrinos we followed up. This was \SI{154.33}{\square\deg} at that time, which resulted in $\mu=0.026$. Employing a Poisson distribution, the \textbf{probability of finding two sources by chance} was $p(2)=\num{3.4e-4}$, while finding one source only had a p-value of $p(1)=\num{2.6e-2}$~\cite{Reusch2022}.

To obtain the probability of finding two neutrinos coincident by chance, we calculated the probability of observing 0 and 1 coincidences, and subtracted these from 1 --- which leaves the probability of observing two or more coincidences:

\begin{equation}
p(2) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^1 \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^k}{k!}
\end{equation}
where the sum is the cumulative distribution function of the Poisson distribution. Using a right-tailed normal distribution, $p(2)=\num{3.4e-4}$ translates to $\SI{3.4}{\sigma}$ (\SI{1.94}{\sigma} for a single association).

We have so far detailed the data reduction for \emph{AT2019fdr}, established that it likely was a TDE --- albeit an unusual one --- modeled its SED and the dust echo we discovered, calculated its energy output and showed that a chance coincidence of two high-energy neutrinos with sources comparable to \emph{AT2019fdr} is quite improbable.

We now need to evaluate if there are models that render \emph{AT2019fdr} capable of producing the observed high-energy neutrino, and STUFF. This will be done in the next section.

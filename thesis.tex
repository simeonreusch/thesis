\chapter{Neutrino Astronomy} \label{theory}
\labch{Neutrino Astronomy}

For millennia, astronomy was exclusively the domain of optics. Until the \nth{17} century, the unaided eye, sensitive to wavelengths from \num{380} to \SI{800}{\nano\m}, was the sole `instrument' \sidecite{Wall2018} in observing the sky.

Astronomy started with observing and predicting the motions of the sun to forecast seasons in ancient Babylon and Egypt\sidenote{In Egypt, the seasons were not particularly prominent, so their practice of tracking the sun relative to Sirius, the brightest star visible, to predict the Nile flooding had a direct impact on people's livelihood.} \sidecite{Linton2004}. Over the centuries, observing the sky evolved into a mature science, ultimately leading to the Copernican Revolution that placed the sun instead of the earth at the center of the solar system. This pre-instrumental period also already saw the observation of galactic transient events, like the supernova (SN) SN185 by Chinese astronomers or the widely observed SN1054.

Astronomy was greatly accelerated by the invention of the telescope by Hans Lippershey, which allowed for the observation of much fainter objects \sidecite{Beckman2021}. Radio and infrared astronomy expanded the observational means to higher wavelengths in the 1930s and 1950s, while UV, X-ray and Gamma-ray astronomy required satellites to escape the absorption of high-energy photons by the earth's atmosphere or -- in the case of very-high-energy Gamma rays -- required the development of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs).

Two important developments in the \nth{19} century further advanced the field: Spectroscopy, allowing the identification of chemical elements in extraterrestrial objects, and photography, which vastly increased the depth of observations by accumulating much more light with the telescope as is possible by eye alone.

After the invention of the telescope, it took another 360 years for the photon to lose its supremacy as the only messenger available. The advent of neutrino astronomy in the 1960s and lastly, gravitational wave astronomy in the 2010s changed that and initiated the era of \textit{multimessenger astronomy}.

Besides those messengers, the early \nth{20} century saw the identification of another potential messenger: Cosmic rays, which are largely highly energetic protons, electrons and helium nuclei. This messenger though comes with a large drawback: Due to their charge, the particles constituting cosmic rays are deflected by magnetic fields on their way through interstellar and intergalactic space, which makes pin-pointing their origin a very hard task \cite{Beckman2021}. 

Contrary to photons -- especially optical ones -- neutrinos are extremely hard to detect, explaining why neutrino astronomy is such a recent development. As this thesis is concerned with the identification of the astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos, this chapter will detail what neutrinos are, how high-energy neutrino astronomy advanced, and which types of objects and events have been proposed as sources of high-energy neutrinos. 

\section{Neutrinos}
Neutrinos were first predicted by Pauli in the 1930s \sidecite{Giunti2007}, given firm theoretical footing by Fermi in 1934 \sidecite{Fermi1934}, and experimentally detected by Reines and Cowan in 1955 \sidecite{Reines1956}.

\subsection{The neutrino hypothesis} \label{neutrino_hypothesis}
Wolfgang Pauli proposed the neutrino as a remedy for the continuous $\beta$-spectrum of decaying uranium. It was discovered that when nuclear elements decay, they emit different particles. Their types of emission were dubbed $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$ radiation; the first being helium-4 nuclei, the second electrons or protons, and lastly energetic photons. Contrary to $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-radiation, the spectrum of $\beta$-radiation turned out to be continuous, while one would expect sharp energy levels for the emitted particles.\todo{Überprüfen.}

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/pauli_neutrino.jpg}
    \caption[Pauli's letter proposing the neutrino]{Pauli's open letter from December 1930, proposing the existence of the neutrino (he called it `neutron' at the time) to the community. Image credit: Pauli Letter Collection, CERN.}
    \labfig{pauli_letter}
\end{marginfigure}

In $\beta$-decay, the nucleus of an atom emits an electron when undergoing the nuclear transition $(A,Z)\rightarrow(A,Z+1) + e^-$. In this scenario, the decay is a two body problem (nucleus and electron), where the emitted electron carries the (quantized) energy lost to the nucleus due to its transition to the final state. As it was known already then, this tight distribution of energy is fixed -- so one would expect a narrow energy spectrum for the emitted electron, as was the case for $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-radiation. But the observed electron spectrum was continuous, hence the puzzlement of the community. Bohr proposed loosening the requirement of energy conservation -- a suggestion Pauli was strongly opposed to\sidenote{He brought forth a though experiment of a closed box, within which $\beta$-decay happens. This box would change weight over time, a result which he deemed paradoxical.} \sidecite{Jensen2000}.

Pauli instead took refuge in what he considered a desperate solution, and suggested that the $\beta$-decay was in fact a \textit{three body problem}, with a neutral particle carrying parts of the released energy \sidecite{Bilenky2012}. This would explain the continous electron spectrum. He also assumed that the hypothetical second particle reacted extremely rarely, which could explain why it had not been observed yet.

The next advancement was due to Enrico Fermi in 1934. By then, the picture of the nucleus had been complemented by the neutron, discovered by James Chadwick two years earlier. Fermi built the first theory of $\beta$-decay in analogy to the description of the emission of photons from excited nuclei \cite{Fermi1934}. \todo{Läuft die über Energielevels?}. He assumed that the electron-neutrino pair is produced when a neutron within the nucleus (which had recently been discovered) transitions into a proton: $n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}$. The predictions from his theory were in fair agreement with observations, provided the neutrino mass was very small \cite{Fermi1934}.

\subsection{Neutrino detections}
It took another 22 years until the neutrino was discovered experimentally. In the meantime, the atomic bomb had been proposed, built, and used twice. As part of the effort to develop a fission bomb, the Savannah River Plant nuclear reactor was constructed. On a more pacifistic note, Reines and Cowan used the hypothesized flux of neutrinos from this reactor to first experimentally detect a neutrino \cite{Reines1956} (later confirmation in \sidecite{Cowan1956}).

The process used by them was the inverse beta decay, by which the predicted neutrino (in fact, an electron antineutrino) could react with a proton, converting it to a neutron and releasing a positron ($\bar{\nu_e} + p \rightarrow n + e^+$). The released positron then annihilates with a free electron within the target material (for which they used $\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CdCl}_2$), releasing two \SI{511}{\kilo\eV} photons in the process, emitted in opposite directions due to momentum conservation. These were then be detected by a liquid scintillator surrounding the target. The neutron diffuses through the target medium for a while until being captured by the cadmium, emitting a delayed photon signal (see Fig. \ref{fig:neutrino_discovery}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{theory/neutrino_discovery_principle.png}
    \caption[Neutrino discovery schematic]{Experimental setup for the discovery of the neutrino. From \cite{Reines1956}.}
    \labfig{neutrino_discovery}
\end{figure}

The extremely low interaction rate, or in other words, the small interaction cross section of the neutrino, required large amounts of target material and liquid scintillator to detect this reaction \cite{Giunti2007}. Ultimately and thanks to the unique event signature detailed above, Reins and Cowan succeeded, reporting a neutrino detection rate of $2.88 \pm 0.22$ counts/hour \cite{Reines1956}.

\subsection{Discovery of the muon neutrino}
Another important step was the discovery of the \textit{muon neutrino}: At the Brookhaven National Lab in the US, muons and Kaons from an accelerator were used to prove the existence of this neutrino flavor. Prior to the experiment, it had already been pointed out by Lee and Yang that the experimental non-detection of the decay $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ strongly hinted at the existence of a muon neutrino. This decay is only allowed if there is no difference between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ \sidecite{Ekspong1993}.

The goal of the Brookhaven experiment was to directly detect the muon neutrino by producing $\pi^+$ through bombarding a Beryllium target with \SI{15}{\giga\eV} protons. These $\pi^+$ nearly all decay to $\mu^+ \nu_\mu$\sidenote{The channel $\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_e$ is strongly suppressed, see \cite{Bilenky2012}.}. In a subsequent decay channel, almost all $\mu^+$ decay, only allowing the muon neutrinos to pass. These were sent to a neutrino detector, consisting of aluminum plates located in a spark chamber. The neutrinos would interact with the nuclei in the aluminum and produce charged leptons. If there was no difference between $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_e$, one would expect detecting $e^-$ and $\mu^-$ in virtually equal numbers. But the experiment detected 29 muons, and the 6 detected electrons could be attributed to background. This proved the existence of the muon neutrino \sidecite{Danby1962}.


\subsection{The solar neutrino problem}

The neutrino was successfully detected. This, combined with the prediction that the process of nuclear fission within the sun should release neutrinos, triggered the question of detecting solar neutrinos. The sun creates neutrinos both via the $pp$ chain and the CNO cycle, in both processes converting four protons and two electrons into a $^4\text{He}$ nucleus and two electron neutrinos: $4p + 2e^- \rightarrow  ~^4\text{He} + 2\nu_e + \SI{26.7}{\mega\eV}$. The energy is then released via photons or via neutrinos carrying kinetic energy \cite{Giunti2007}.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/sno_flux.png}
    \caption[Solar neutrino flux measured by SNO]{The solar neutrino flux as measured by SNO. The x-axis shows the $\nu_e$ flux, while the y-axis shows the flux of solar $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$. The intersection point shows the best-fit flux values for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$, with a resulting flavor ratio of $\sim 1/3$ for all types. From \cite{Ahmad2002}.}
    \labfig{sno_flux}
\end{marginfigure}

Solar electron neutrinos were first detected in the 1960s in the Homestake experiment by Davis. He operated a tank located underground in the Homestake mine, filled with \SI{380}{\meter\cubed} of tetrachloroethene, which allowed antineutrino capture via $\nu_e +~ ^{37}\text{Cl} \rightarrow ~ ^{37}\text{Ar}^+ + e^-$. First results after 150 days of data taking resulted in an upper neutrino flux limit much lower than the theoretical expectations \sidecite{Davis1968}. The experiment would run continously from 1970 to 1994, detecting a neutrino flux about $1/2-1/3$ of the expected flux. The fact that the measured flux was consistently lower than the predicted one, despite various checks and improvements, became known as the \textit{solar neutrino problem} \sidecite{Bahcall1976}.

A solution to the solar neutrino was first proposed by Gribov and Pontecorvo in 1969 \sidecite{Gribov1969}: The missing electron neutrinos from the sun could have oscillated into neutrinos of a different flavor while traveling to earth. This proposed neutrino oscillation was shown by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in 2002; evidence for the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos was already brought forth four years earlier by the Super-Kamiokande detector \sidecite{Fukuda1998}. The SNO detector was sensitive to two types of interactions: One channel in which only $\nu_e$ could participate, and one open to neutrinos of all flavors. It was determined that the flux of solar $\nu_e$ \sidenote{The existence of the tau neutrino had been confirmed one year earlier by the \textit{Direct Observation of the Nu Tau} (DONUT) experiment \cite{Kodama2001}.} was $1/3$ of the total neutrino flux (consisting of $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$). This result was in full agreement with theoretical predictions for the solar neutrinos flux, and directly showed that neutrinos do oscillate \sidecite{Ahmad2002}.

These oscillations can be described by the $3x3$ unitary transformation matrix known as the \textit{Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata} (PMNS) matrix, that works analogous to the matrix describing the quark flavor mixing (\textit{Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa}, or short CKM). The values within this matrix must be determined experimentally, as there is no underlying theory predicting them.

\subsection{Neutrino mass}
By observing solar neutrino oscillations, the SNO experiment also established the fact that neutrinos have mass -- contradicting the standard model of particle physics. Only massive particles allow osciallation between flavor eigenstates and mass eigenstates. It does therefore not make sense to ask for the mass of e.g. an electron neutrino, as this flavor eigenstate is a superposition of different mass states. One can speak of the \textit{effective} electron neutrino mass, though; this is defined as

\begin{equation}
m_\nu = \sqrt{ \Sigma_i |U_{ei}|^2 m_i^2 }
\end{equation}
where $U$ is the PMNS matrix describing the neutrino state mixing. If one could take individual mass measurements of the electron neutrino, one would measure the mass $m_i$ with probability $|U_{ei}|^2$.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/mass_history.pdf}
    \caption[Neutrino mass upper limit history]{The history of upper limits on the neutrino mass. From \cite{Aker2022}.}
    \labfig{mass_history}
\end{marginfigure}

Neutrino oscillations are only sensitive to the squared mass differences between the three mass states. One way to measure the average proper neutrino mass is the close inspection of the beta-decay\sidenote{See Section \ref{neutrino_hypothesis}.} spectrum. The most recent experiment to determine neutrino masses, the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN) uses the beta decay of tritium. If the neutrino were massless, the energy spectrum of the emitted electron would extend up to the total energy of the decay (\SI{18.6}{\eV}). If the neutrino mass is higher, the electron energy can never exceed the energy of that neutrino mass. Note that in principle one could obtain all three neutrino masses from such an experiment, but with current technology, one cannot resolve them. The latest upper limit from KATRIN on the neutrino mass is $m_\nu < \SI{0.8}{\eV}$ at the \SI{90}{\percent} confidence level \sidecite{Aker2022}.


\subsection{Current understanding} \label{neutrinos_current}
Modern understanding knows three flavors of neutrinos, which are superposition of three mass states. Their mass is small, but exists. Neutrinos have neither electromagnetic, nor color charge, but a weak hypercharge. This weak hypercharge makes them partake in weak interactions, which are mediated by exchanging $W$ or $Z$ bosons. Fig. \ref{fig:neutrino_interactions} details some possible interaction channels, all constituting deep inelastic scattering with the quarks contained in nucleons, which is the dominant interaction mode for high-energy neutrinos with energies starting from several \unit{\giga\eV} in a medium.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{theory/neutrino_interactions_feynman_short.pdf}
    \caption[Neutrino interactions]{Different neutrino interaction channels for deep inelastic scattering. \textit{Left}: interaction of neutrinos (antineutrinos) with quarks by exchange of a $W^{\pm}$ boson, \textit{right} interaction of neutrinos of all types by exchange of a $Z$ boson. The interaction on the right is called \textit{neutral current} (NC) interaction, while the one on the left is dubbed \textit{charged current} (CC) interaction.}
    \labfig{neutrino_interactions}
\end{figure}

Interactions that involve electromagnetically charged $W^-$ bosons are called \textit{charged current} (CC) interactions, while those involving neutral $Z$ bosons are called \textit{neutral current} (NC) interactions. The beta decay of a neutron into a proton e.g. is a charged current interaction.

The cross section for neutrinos with matter significantly increases with energy, as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:high_energy_nu_xsec}.

\section{Low-Energy Neutrino Astronomy}

\subsection{Stellar neutrinos}
As mentioned above, neutrinos from the sun have already been detected in the 1960s.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/solar_neutrinos.pdf}
    \caption[Predicted solar neutrino flux]{Predicted solar neutrino flux. From \cite{Agostini2018}.}
    \labfig{solar_neutrino_flux} 
\end{marginfigure}

Low-energy neutrinos, i.e. those carrying energies up to $\mathcal{O}(\unit{\mega\eV})$, are produced in stellar fusion processes and in supernovae. The primary stellar fusion process we can study is of course the sun.

As already mentioned above, the neutrinos from the sun stem from two processes: The $pp$ chain and the CNO cycle. Within the $pp$ chain, neutrinos get produced by the proton-neutron conversion preceding the fusion of $p+n$ to $^2 \text{H}$. This conversion either happens via the $\beta^+$ decay $p \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e$, resulting in a continuous neutrino spectrum (red curve in Fig. \ref{fig:solar_neutrino_flux}), or via electron capture $e^- + p \rightarrow n + \nu_e$, which results in a line spectrum (leftmost blue line).

Towards \unit{\mega\eV} energies, the solar neutrino flux is dominated by the decay of $^8\text{B}\rightarrow ~^8\text{Be} + e^+ + \nu_e$ (green curve) happening in one of the subsequent evolutions of the $pp$ chain. This particular process does not contribute much to the radiative energy output of the sun, but it was the responsible mechanism for the solar neutrino flux of which $2/3$ were missing, constituting the aforementioned solar neutrino puzzle.

\subsection{Supernovae} \label{sne}
Only with the first extragalactic neutrino source the era of neutrino astronomy truly began. This source was SN1987a, a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that occured in February 1987.

Since Kepler's supernova almost 500 years ago\sidenote{A type Ia supernova (see below) that occured in 1604 in the Milky Way}, SN1987a was the first supernova observable by naked eye alone\sidenote{With a brightness of 3-4 mag!}. This was possible as its host galaxy, the LMC, is very close by (\SI{\sim50}{\kilo\parsec})\sidecite{Spurio2018}. SN1987a was the core-collapse of Sanduleak-69202, a blue supergiant, resulting in a type IIP supernova \sidecite{Utrobin2021}. After the optical detection of the source, and following a hint by John Bahcall, the teams of the neutrino detectors Kamiokande-II, Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) and the Baksan Neutrino Observatory (BNO) found a burst of neutrinos predating the light from the supernova by 3 hours \sidecite{Hirata1987,Bionta1987}.

In total, 25 neutrinos were detected by the three instruments (had IceCube already been operational in 1987, it would have detected \num{\sim13000} neutrinos \sidecite{Halzen2017}). These rates were in agreement with theoretical models for core-collapse supernovae, assuming that \SI{99}{\percent} of the supernova energy is released in the form of neutrinos.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/sn1987a_flux.pdf}
    \caption[Neutrinos from SN1987a]{The neutrinos from SN1987a, as measured by Kamiokande-II, IMB and BNO (Baksan). Fig. adapted \cite{Grupen2005}.}
    \labfig{sn1987a_flux}
\end{marginfigure}

Historically, supernovae were classified according to the presence of lines in their spectra. SNe of type I are lacking hydrogen lines in their spectra, in contrast to type II SNe that show hydrogen lines. SNe are further subdivided into SNe Ia that display silicon lines, SNe Ib that do not display silicon lines, but helium lines, and SNe Ic that have neither.

SNe Ia are a class sui generis. Their underlying physical scenario is a white dwarf accreting matter from a companion star. The accretion eventually causes the star's mass to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of $\sim 1.4~M_\odot$ at which gravitational force overcomes the electron degeneracy pressure, and the star begins to burn carbon due to the higher density. At one point, a runaway thermonuclear reaction starts, and the white dwarf blows up violently \sidecite{Maguire2017}. As the Chandrasekhar limit is the same everywhere, the luminosity of that explosion is to first order the same for all SNe Ia, making them excellent instruments to measure cosmological distances. They are not expected to produce large quantities of neutrinos, though \sidecite{Alsabti2017}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics{theory/ccsn.pdf}
    \caption[Core-collapse supernova]{Schematic of a core-collapse supernova. Fusion stops in the core (b), causing it to collapse until neutron degeneracy prevents further collapse. A proto neutron star forms in the center (c). The infalling material bounces back from the degeneracy border and forms a shock front (d). The stalling shock is revigorated by the intense flux of neutrinos from the proto neutron star (e) and expands outwards (f). Adapted from \url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Core_collapse_scenario.png} (which is most likely adapted from \cite{Janka2012}).}
    \labfig{ccsn_schematic}
\end{figure}

In contrast to SNe Ia, all other types of SNe are so-called \textit{core-collapse} supernovae (CCSNe).
Stars generate energy by first buring hydrogen. When a massive star has exhausted its hydrogen, fusion subsides and the gravitational pull compresses it further, until temperatures suitable for helium buring are reached. This process repeats for most of the iron group elements (Fe, Co, Ni).

A CCSN happens when a star exceeding $8~M_\odot$ has reached its final fusion stage, the fusion of silicon to iron. Iron has the highest binding energy of all elements, therefore fusing iron to heavier elements would release no energy, and the fusion chain stops. With the fusion subsided, the radiation pressure that so far prevented the star from collapsing in on itself stops. The infalling material compresses the core of the star. As soon as the core becomes incompressible due to neutron degeneracy pressure described by the Pauli exlusion principle, the infalling material bounces back from the incompressible core and blows into space. The remaining neutron star in the center either survives, or the infalling material eventually causes it to overcome neutrino degeneracy pressure and collapses it into a black hole \cite{Alsabti2017}.

The spectral differences between SNe types Ib, Ic and Ii can be explained by the presence or absence of the two outermost shells: hydrogen and helium (see Fig. \ref{fig:sn_shells}). If both shells are already far away from the star, the SN is of type Ic (neither H nor He lines are present in the spectrum). If only the helium shell remains, the type is Ib, and if both shells are still present, the collapse will result in a type II supernova.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/sn_shells.pdf}
    \caption[CCSN shells]{CCSN shells. The presence or absence of helium and hydrogen shells explains the differences in the respective spectra of CCSNe type Ib, Ic and II.}
    \labfig{sn_shells} 
\end{marginfigure}

In the centers of these, neutron stars with masses of $1.5-2~M_\odot$ are created. These need to release large amounts of gravitational binding energy during their creation. Because the environment at the center of the CCSN is dense and optically thick, photons are unable to escape: They immediately produce electron-positron pairs, which in turn are quickly absorbed by the surrounding matter.

Instead, \SI{99}{\percent} of the binding energy is carried away by neutrinos (see panels (e) and (f) in Fig. \ref{fig:ccsn_schematic}). The energy radiated by the nascent neutron star via neutrinos typically amounts to \SI{\sim1.5e53}{\erg}, distributed equally over all three families, with a typical energy carried per neutrino of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\mega\eV})$ \sidecite{Lunardini2017}. 

It has to be noted though that the exact mechanism the neutrinos play in the SN explosion is still insufficiently understood, as one has to rely on data from one observation only, as well as numerical models. Eventually, a CCSN within our galaxy might come to the rescue \sidecite{Janka2017}.

\section{Cosmic Rays}
As the production mechanisms for cosmic rays and high-energy neutrinos are intricately linked, a few words need to be said about the former.

\subsection{Discovery}
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/hess_balloon.png}
    \caption[Hess in his balloon]{Hess in his balloon after landing in Brandenburg, Germany in 1912, having just discovered cosmic rays. From \cite{Steinmaurer1985}.}
    \labfig{hess_balloon} 
\end{marginfigure}
Cosmic rays were discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess. At the time, it had already been discovered that electroscopes -- devices measuring electric charge and voltage -- sometimes suddenly discharged. This was attributed to particles ionizing the air in the vessel, making it conductive and therefore allowing it to discharge. This was corroborated by the fact that reduced air pressure would slow the speed of the discharge. Another hint was that when shielding the isolated vessel, the ionization would decrease. The source of these ionizing particles was unknown, though.

Hess measured the flux of ionizing radiation with three electrometers during several balloon journeys. In total, he carried out 10 balloon ascents in the time period of 1911--1913. The first ascent over \SI{5}{\km} in August 1912 marked the discovery of cosmic rays, when he registered a 16-fold increase in ionization measured by the electrometers at that height. Hess consequently concluded that the ionizing radiation must be of extra-terrestrial origin. \sidecite{Steinmaurer1985}.

\subsection{Composition and energy spectrum}
More than 100 years later, we know that this ionizing radiation consists of particles, spanning a broad range of energies. These particles are mostly protons, but all stable charged particles and nuclei with lifetimes of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{e6}{\year})$ can be found; most prominently protons, electrons, helium, but also e.g. carbon, oxygen and iron \sidecite{Workman2022}.

As can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:cr_spectrum}, the cosmic ray spectrum spans a wide range of energies, from a few \unit{\mega\eV} up to \SI{e21}{\eV}, with the higher end of the energy spectrum constituting \textit{Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays} (UHECR).

\begin{marginfigure}

    \caption[Cosmic ray spectrum]{Cosmic ray spectrum, as seen by a range of experiments. From \cite{Hillas2006}.}
    \labfig{cr_spectrum} 
\end{marginfigure}

The UHECR part of the spectrum is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:uhecr_spectrum}. It can be described by a series of power laws with different spectral indices, i.e. $E^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ being the spectral index. The UHECR spectrum shows several interesting features, dubbed the \textit{knee}, the anatomically challenging \textit{second knee}, and the \textit{ankle}. These are the points where the spectral index changes, and which are possibly associated with a transition to a new source class, e.g. from galactic to extragalactic sources around the ankle (see \sidecite{Taylor2016}). This is still an active field of research \cite{Workman2022}.

If high-energy neutrinos are produced in the processes responsible for the creation of cosmic rays (see below), the neutrinos stemming from cosmic rays with energies higher than the ankle should be mainly produced by extragalactic sources \sidecite{Halzen2006}.

    \labfig{uhecr_hillas_criterion} 
\end{marginfigure}

Identifying the sources of UHECR remains a challenge. As the cosmic ray particles are charged, they are deflected by magnetic fields encountered on their way to earth, obscuring their origin. What \textit{is} known though is that their extremely high energies necessitate extreme environments in which they can be produced.

In the 1980s, Hillas proposed the requirement that the efficient acceleration of a charged particle needs an accelerator that is able confine the particle during acceleration: This means that the source needs to be larger than the particle's Larmor radius \sidecite{Rieger2022}. This introduces a bound on the possible sources for UHECR cosmic ray sources:

\begin{equation}
    E \leq 10^{20} Z \bigg(\frac{B}{\SI{10}{\micro\gauss}}\bigg) \bigg(\frac{R}{\SI{10}{\kilo\parsec}} \bigg)~\unit{\eV},
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is the cosmic ray particle charge number, $B$ is the magnetic field strength of the source, and $R$ is the characteristic source dimension \cite{Rieger2022}. Sources that match this criterion for the production of UHECR protons and iron nuclei with an energy of \SI{e20}{\eV} are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:uhecr_hillas_criterion}. As one can see, a variety of extreme environments are possible sources of UHECR, some of these also hot candidates for the production of high-energy neutrinos. 

\subsection{Diffusive shock acceleration} \label{dsa}
There is a variety of acceleration mechanisms for UHECR. An important process, \textit{diffusive shock acceleration} (DSA), was introduced in the late 1970s. DSA is thought to occur in the presence of shocks that occur e.g. in core-collapse supernovae\sidenote{See Section \ref{sne}}. DSA requires shocks, and shocks require that matter, for example in the form of a plasma, moves with supersonic speed through a surrounding medium.

To understand DSA, one has to differentiate between an \textit{upstream} region in front of the moving shock front, and a \textit{downstream} region behind the shock front. Consider a shock front moving with a velocity $\vec{v_s}$ through a medium as seen in the observer's rest frame (red line in Fig. \ref{fig:dsa}). If we switch to the rest frame of the shock front, it encounters the upstream medium as flowing towards it with speed $\vec{u_u}=-\vec{v_s}$. Downstream, behind the shock, the velocity of material $u_d$ will be lower: Mass convervation requires that $\rho_u u_u = \rho_d u_d$. In astrophysical shocks containing a fully ionized plasma, the compression ratio $R=\rho_d/\rho_u$ can be as high as 4 \sidecite{Longair2011}. Because $R=u_d/u_u$, the velocity of material downstream (behind the shock front) $u_d$ will then only be $1/4 u_u$.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/dsa.pdf}
    \caption[Diffusive shock acceleration]{Sketch illustrating diffusive shock acceleration. A shock front is moving with velocity $v_s$ with respect to an upstream medium. A test particle crosses the shock front twice, each time gaining energy. The length of the arrows are proportional to the velocity.}
    \labfig{dsa} 
\end{marginfigure}

Now consider some test particles upstream, ahead of the shock front rushing towards it. Within a frame of reference in which the upstream gas is at rest, their velocity distribution will be isotropic. Assume that the diffusion on both sides of the shock front is mediated via collisionless processes. This means that momentum and energy transfers between particles are mediated elastically by magnetic irregularities in the plasma (and Coulomb scattering can be neglected). When a test particle eventually with initial velocity $v_1$ (blue arrow in Fig. \ref{fig:dsa}) crosses the shock front to the downstream region, it will see a plasma rushing towards it with speed $|u_u-u_d| = (1-0.25)~u_u$, which equals 3/4 of the shock front velocity $v_s$. In the downstream region, they will again be scattered collisionlessly, and receive a small net energy gain of $\Delta E/E = v_s/c$. For a simple derivation of this energy gain, confer \cite{Longair2011}.

This results in a higher velocity $v_2$. After some time, the particle might cross the shock front again, this time into the upstream region. From the now isotropized particle's frame, the upstream region will again rush in with $0.75~v_s$, and the process repeats, resulting in another gain in energy, and a higher $v_3$ \sidecite{Urosevic2019}.

During each crossing, a particle with initial energy $E_0$ will gain an energy fraction $\beta$, resulting in energy $E=\beta E_0$. If $P$ denotes the probability that a particle \textit{stays} within the accelerating region, the number of particles after $k$ crossings can be written as $N=N_0 P^k $, and they will have energies $E=E_0\beta^k$.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{theory/dsa_mc.pdf}
    \caption[DSA Monte Carlo]{Monte Carlo simulation of a test particle near the shock front. The particle position wildly varies (solid line), but its velocity $v_p$ (dotted line) increases each time it crosses the shock front at $x=0$. Adapted from \cite{Baring1997}}
    \labfig{dsa_mc} 
\end{marginfigure}

If one solves both equations for $k$ and sets them equal, one obtains
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ln (N/N_0)}{\ln (E/E_0)} = \frac{\ln P}{\ln \beta}.
\end{equation}
By rearranging we get
\begin{equation}
    \frac{N}{N_0} = \bigg(\frac{E}{E_0}\bigg)^{\ln P / \ln \beta}
\end{equation}
To obtain the differential energy spectrum, we differentiate with respect to $E$ and get
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:diff_e_spec}
    N(E)~\text{d} E = C\times E^{(\ln P/\ln\beta)-1}~\text{d} E
\end{equation}

The result is a power law with index $\frac{\ln P}{\ln \beta}$, which is indeed what was already stipulated by experimental data.

We already know that on average $\Delta E/E \simeq v_s/c$. $v_s$ can be translated to $\frac{4}{3} v_p$ where $v_p$ is the particle's speed, so -- on average -- $\Delta E/E = \frac{4}{3}\frac{v_p}{c}$. Then, $\beta = E/E_0 = 1 + \frac{4}{3}\frac{v_p}{c}$.\todo{explain}

What is missing is an expression for $P$. To obtain this, we need to estimate the rate at which particles drop out of the system or are `swept away'. As argued by \cite{Longair2011} (and originally presented by \sidecite{Bell1978}), the average number of particles crossing the shock is $\frac{1}{4} n c$, with $n$ being the particle number density. This is true in both directions up- and downstream. The difference though is that downstream particles are `advected' away from the shock further downstream and out of the system, as they are isotropic in that frame. The dropout rate is $nv_p=\frac{1}{4}nv_s$. From this it follows that the fraction of particles lost (per unit time) is $\frac{1}{4}nv_s/\frac{1}{4}nc = v_s/c$. The survival probability $P$ is thus $P=(1-v_s/c)$. 

With that, we can compute 
\begin{equation}
    \ln P = \ln ( 1-\frac{v_s}{c}) \simeq -\frac{v_s}{c},
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
   \ln \beta = \ln(1+\frac{4}{3}\frac{v_p}{c}) \simeq \frac{4}{3}\frac{v_p}{c} = \frac{v_s}{c}.
\end{equation}
This gives us $\frac{\ln P}{\ln \beta} \simeq -1$. Inserting this into Eq. \ref{eqn:diff_e_spec} yields
\begin{equation}
    N(E)~\text{d} E \propto E^{-2}~\text{d} E.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the resulting differential energy spectrum has a spectral index of 2. This somewhat differs from the experimentally found spectral index of 2.7 up to the knee. This can be explained by the fact there are several assumptions at play here: The shock is assumed to be non-relativistic, in an ideal gas and constant escape probability. Inefficiencies in the shock, and the inclusion of shock-amplified magnetic fields can both harden the spectral index \cite{Spurio2018}.

\subsection{Interaction and neutrino production} \label{cr_interactions}
As discussed above, cosmic rays are most likely produced in astrophysical shocks, as this can explain the power-law structure of the energy distribution. The particles accelerated within shocks might now interact with either hadrons, or photons in their vicinity or on their way to earth. For simplicity, this section focuses on the interaction of cosmic ray protons, but it applies to heavier nuclei as well.

\textbf{$pp$ interactions} When cosmic ray protons encounter gas, either at the source location or while crossing the universe, they can interact with this gas, here assumed to consist of protons only for simplicity. The resulting $pp$ interactions produces lots of unstable hadrons, which decay. Those decays are dominated by pion production. Ignoring all secondary hadrons $X$ (which can also decay via pions), possible decay channels of these pions are:

\begin{eqnarray}
     \pi^\pm + X &\contour{black}{$\rightarrow$}& \mu^\pm + \nu_\mu (\bar{\nu}_\mu)~~~ \contour{black}{$\rightarrow$} ~~~ e^\pm + \nu_e(\bar{\nu}_e) + \bar{\nu}_\mu(\nu_\mu)\\
     \pi^0 + X &\contour{black}{$\rightarrow$}& 2\gamma
 \end{eqnarray} 
As can be seen, $\pi^\pm$ decay into positive (negative) muons and a muon (anti-)neutrino. Those muons will decay into electrons (positrons), electron (anti-)neutrinos and muon (anti-)neutrinos. The decay of the neutral $\pi^0$ does not generate neutrinos. For pion decays, an average neutrino flavor content of $\nu_e$:$\nu_\mu$:$\nu_\tau = 1:2:0$ is expected. Neutrino oscillation on the way to earth washes out this initial difference, with an expected flavor content of $1:1:1$ \cite{Workman2022}.

The energy of the pion decay products is expected to trace the initial proton energy spectrum. If the proton interaction rate is fairly independent of their energy, then they will lose a fraction of their energy, which will then be converted into the production of pions, and subsequently muons. With this, the resulting neutrino spectrum is expected to have a similar shape as the initial cosmic ray spectrum. \todo{warum?, ergänzen, source}

\textbf{$p\gamma$ interactions}
Cosmic ray protons can also interact with radiation fields. The cross section for these interactions is large near the $\Delta^+$ resonance. The dominant $\Delta^+$ decay modes again contain pions:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta^+ ~~ &\contour{black}{$\rightarrow$}& n + \pi^+ \\
    \Delta^+ ~~ &\contour{black}{$\rightarrow$}& p + \pi^0
\end{eqnarray}
The pions will again decay according to the channels already discussed for $pp$ interactions. The secondary neutrons might decay via beta decay, and produce electron antineutrinos. Also here, the neutrino spectrum is expected to trace the cosmic ray spectrum.\todo{source}


\section{High-Energy Neutrino Astronomy}
\subsection{Interacting supernovae} \label{interacting_sne}
As already detailed in Section \ref{sne}, CCSNe are thought to produce copious amounts of \unit{\mega\eV}-neutrinos. Interestingly, certain types of CCSNe are thought not only to produce such comparably low-energy neutrinos, but also \unit{\tera\eV} neutrinos. Optical observations have stipulated that supernova progenitors often violently eject material into the circumstellar region in the years to centuries prior to their explosion \sidecite{Ofek2014}. When the supernova happens, ejecta are driven into this circumstellar material (CSM).

SNe of type IIn are a subclass first stipulated by Schlegel \sidecite{Schlegel1990}: The Balmer emission features of early IIn spectra, most prominently the $H_\alpha$ region, show narrow lines on top of a broad component \sidecite{Taddia2013}. The broad component is caused by the supernova itself, but the narrow lines result from interaction of the SN blast-wave with the CSM. This process photo-ionizes the CSM, which results in narrow hydrogen lines.

Such a system might be promising for the production of high-energy neutrinos, as highlighted in \sidecite{Kurahashi2022}. When the SN ejecta -- expanding with velocities of \SIrange{3000}{10000}{\km\per\s} -- hit the CSM, a shock wave starts to propagate through it. Particle acceleration within the shock is predicted to happen at the moment of \textit{shock breakout}. This is the time when the optical depths of the shock drops below $\approx c/v$, with $v$ being the shock velocity. As soon as the radiation can escape, the shock is no longer radiation-mediated, and protons can be accelerated to high energies \sidecite{Waxman2017}. This emission seizes after the shock decelerates or reaches the outer edge of the CSM. 

These accelerated protons are expected to generate high-energy neutrinos, either by $pp$ or $p\gamma$ interactions, both detailed in Section \ref{cr_interactions}. The resulting neutrinos are expected to range from \unit{\giga\eV} to hundreds of \unit{\tera\eV}, reaching their maximum flux shortly after shock breakout \sidecite{Petropoulou2017,Murase2018}.\todo{check, more content}

\subsection{Gamma-ray bursts}
Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) were discovered by accident by the \textit{Vela} satellites designed to monitor nuclear detonations as part of a partial test ban treaty between the US and the USSR in the 1960s. 16 bursts of high-energy photon events recorded by those satellites were published in 1973. This kicked off a flurry of research, as a terrestrial or solar origin of these gamma-ray bursts could be excluded \sidecite{Klebesadel1973}.

% \chapter{Candidate TDE AT2019fdr: A Possible Source?} \label{at2019fdr}
% \labch{AT2019fdr}
% AT2019fdr emerged as a candidate when following up the high-energy IceCube neutrino IC200530A. The gold alert\sidenote{See Section \ref{ic_event_selection}} neutrino was detected on May 30, 2020 with a \SI{90}{\percent} rectangular uncertainty area of \SI{25.4}{\square\deg}, a signalness of 0.59 and an estimated neutrino energy of \SI{82.2}{\tera\eV} \cite{IC200530A1}.

% Two more sources were inititally published by us as candidate sources (SN2020lls and SN2020lam), but both could be ruled out with follow-up observations. For details on these, see Section \ref{SN2020lls} and \ref{SN2020lam}. This left AT2019fdr as the only remaining neutrino source candidate, a long lived optical transient located at RA $= 257.278575$ and Dec $= +26.855758$, with a distance to the reported neutrino best-fit location of \SI{1.72}{\degree}.

% At the moment of neutrino arrival, the transient was already 400 days old. It was originally discovered May 13, 2019 by \textit{AMPEL} \sidecite{at2019fdr_disc}, with a first detection on May 3, 2019. The neutrino arrived about 10 months after the optical peak. The peak flux in the ZTF \textit{g}-band was \SI{1.3e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. The redshift of $z=0.2666$ was inferred from the Balmer lines visible in a spectrum taken on July 3, 2019 with the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the P200. The peak \textit{g}-band luminosity calculated with this redshift, $L_\text{peak}=\SI{2.9e44}{\erg\per\s}$, showed that AT2019fdr was an extraordinarily luminous event\sidenote{Here and in the following I will use a standard flat cosmology with $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$ and $H_0=\SI{70}{\km\per\s\per\mega\parsec}$.}.

% The long-duration flare was initially tentatively classified as a superluminous supernova of type IIn (SLSN IIn). A peculiarity of this event is that it occured close to the core of its host galaxy SDSSCGB 6856.2, a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy, a type of AGN. The mean angular separation to the host position as reported in the \textit{Gaia} DR2 was \SI{0.03 \pm 0.15}{\arcsecond}. Due to this proximity, it was systematically followed up by ZTF program dedicated to study flares in NLSy1 galaxies. 

% In a paper describing the sample of such flares detected during ZTF Phase I, a \textit{TDE interpretation} of AT2019fdr was stipulated \sidecite{Frederick2021}. The authors outright rejected a SLSN interpretation, and also argued against an AGN origin of the flare. The reasons for disfavoring the SLN hypothesis were the 
% long-lived U-band and UV emission, emission at the blue end of the Balmer line profiles, the overall longevity of the flare and it nuclear location close to the center of its host galaxy \cite{Frederick2021}.

% \end{figure*}

% In the following, I will give an overview over the observations in different wavelengths, the reductions of the near infrared observations triggered by us, modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED), interpretation of the delayed infrared signal as dust echo, revisit the TDE interpretation and calculate the chance of observing an event comparable to AT2019fdr in temporal and spatial coincidence with a high-energy neutrino.

% \section{Multi-wavelength Observations}
% As AT2019fdr was discovered close to the core of its host galaxy, it was followed up as part of regular ZTF TDE group activities from early on, including ToO observations by \textit{Swift} UVOT and XRT. 

% After observing the neutrino, we triggered additional follow up by \textit{Swift} UVOT, requested multi-epoch near-infrared observations with the Wide Field Infrared Camera (WIRC) \sidecite{Wilson2003} on the P200, and triggered multi-epoch radio observations with VLA. 

% Furthermore, we analyzed data by the Large Array Telescope (LAT) \sidecite{Atwood2009} aboard the \textit{Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope} (\textit{Fermi}), analyzed four epochs of observations by the Extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) telescope \sidecite{Predehl2021} aboard the \textit{Spectrum Roentgen Gamma} (\textit{SRG}) \sidecite{Sunyaev2021} space mission. 

% All detections and upper limits except for the radio data are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_light_curve}. As one can see, the flare was very long lived, with a moderately fast rise (\SI{\sim100}{\day} until optical peak), a short decay phase followed by a plateau, and lastly an exponential decay with a seemingly constant decay rate \sidecite{Reusch2022}.

% \subsection{Gamma-ray limits}

% \begin{marginfigure}

%     \labfig{fermi_satellite}
% \end{marginfigure}

% The details of the \textit{Fermi} LAT analysis were published in \sidecite{Velzen2021}. The one year long time window analyzed for AT2019fdr spanned from the first optical detection of the source on May 3, 2019, until the arrival of the neutrino on May 30, 2020.

% No gamma-ray sources were detected significantly (\SI{\geq 5}{\sigma}), neither new sources nor previously known sources from the 10 year \textit{Fermi} LAT Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL-DR2) \sidecite{Abdollahi2020,Ballet2020}. The \SI{95}{\percent} CL upper limit derived for this time window within the energy bin of \SIrange{0.1}{800}{\giga\eV} is \SI{1e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. This upper limit was calculated by testing a point-source hypothesis at the location of AT2019fdr, assuming a power-law spectrum of the form $\text{d}N/\text{d}E \propto E^{-\Gamma}$, with a spectral index $\Gamma=2$ \cite{Velzen2021}.

% \subsection{X-ray observations} \label{x_ray_obs}
% The sky region of AT2019 was visited four times by \textit{SRG} with a six-month cadence. The first visit was March 13--14, 2020. Only on the third visit the source was detected, which can be counted as evidence for temporal evolution in X-ray wavelengths. All measurements and the upper limits and detections derived from these are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_light_curve} and listed in Table \ref{tab:at2019fdr_erosita}.

% \end{table}

% The single detection from March 11, 2021 revealed a very soft thermal spectrum. As can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:erosita_fit}, the best-fit blackbody temperature was \SI[parse-numbers = false]{56^{+32}_{-26}}{\eV}, with the errors being \SI{68}{\percent} for one parameter of interest. In the source rest frame, this measurement corresponds to a temperature of \SI[parse-numbers = false]{71^{+41}_{-33}}{\eV}. This renders the X-ray spectrum of AT2019fdr one of the softest spectra of the TDEs discovered by \textit{SRG}/eROSITA so far \sidecite{Sazonov2021}. 

% The equivalent hydrogen column density had a best-fit value of $\text{NH}=\SI[parse-numbers = false]{1.47^{+2.80}_{-1.25}\times10^{21}}{\per\square\cm}$. That value is consistent -- within errors -- with the galactic value of $\text{NH}_\text{Gal} = \SI{0.40e21}{\per\square\cm}$. There is some degeneracy between the neutral hydrogen column density and the inferred blackbody temperature; this is usual for soft sources. However, with $T_\text{bb}=\SI{131}{\eV}$ at the \SI{95}{\percent} confidence level, the temperature upper bound is still fairly low \cite{Reusch2022}.

% \end{figure}

% As noted above, \textit{Swift} XRT had already observed AT2019fdr 14 times prior to the neutrino arrival \cite{Frederick2021}. We requested a prompt ToO observation after the source emerged as a neutrino candidate, which was carried out on June 7, 2020 with a \SI{2000}{\s} exposure.

% The data was reduced with the publicly available \texttt{Swift XRT data products generator} \sidecite{Centre2020} in the energy range of \SIrange{0.3}{10}{\kilo\eV}. As all 14 observations prior to the neutrino arrival were non-detections, those were binned (total exposure: \SI{20700}{\s}) to compute a \SI{3}{\sigma} energy flux upper limit of \SI{1.4e-13}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. The upper flux limit for the post-neutrino observation was \SI{4.7e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. To convert photon counts to to energy flux, I employed the \texttt{HEASARC WebPIMMS} tool \sidecite{Arida2020}. The blackbody temperature was set to the \SI{56}{\eV} measured by \textit{SRG}/eROSITA, and the best-fit neutral hydrogen column density from the same measurement was used \cite{Reusch2022}.

% The ZTF optical observations were processed with \texttt{fpbot}\sidenote{See Section \ref{fpbot}}. The science-ready \textit{Swift} data was retrieved from the \textit{Swift} archive\sidenote{\url{https://www.swift.ac.uk/swift_portal}}.

The brightness of the transient was measured using \texttt{uvotsource} of the same package. The aperture used was \SI{3}{\arcsecond}, with a far bigger radius used for the background level extraction. We calibrated the photometry with files made available by September 2020 and employed the methods of \sidecite{Breeveld2011} to convert the measured magnitudes to the AB system\sidenote{See Section \ref{magnitudes}}. The extracted and converted magnitudes were then corrected by subtracting the synthetic host model described in Section \ref{synthetic_host_model}. \cite{Reusch2022}.

% As the extraction of the infrared measurements was more involved due to host-galaxy blending, this will be detailed in a full Section below.

% \subsection{Radio observations}
% After the neutrino detection, we applied for Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) on the VLA. Three individual measurements were taken on July 3, September 13 and November 7, 2020. The first epoch was carried out in the \SIrange{2}{4}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{8}{12}{\giga\Hz}. In the subsequent epochs, we added the \SIrange{1}{2}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{4}{8}{\giga\Hz} bands. Delay, bandpass and flux calibration were performed on the source 3C 286, and the nearby source J1716+2152 was used for the complex gain calibration. For this, the VLA calibration pipeline in the Common Astrometry Software Application (CASA) \sidecite{Bean2022} was used, and imaging was performed with the CASA task \texttt{tclean}. Finally, the target flux density was measured by fitting a point source in the image plane \cite{Reusch2022}.

% \begin{marginfigure}

%     \caption[VLA]{VLA in New Mexico. Image credit: NSF.}
%     \labfig{vla}
% \end{marginfigure}

% Flux from the source location was measured in all three epochs. At all epochs, the flux density declined with higher frequencies. While epoch 1 and 2 showed no evolution in the \SIrange{4}{8}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{8}{12}{\giga\Hz} bands, the final epoch suggested reduced flux and subsequently a spectral steepening in these bands. Intensive testing revealed that the reduced flux was not intrinsic to the source, but rather significant atmospheric phase changes between the calibrator scans. This reduced the measured flux densities during epoch 3 due to decorrelation. As the source flux density was too low for self calibration, the effect could not be corrected for. We concluded that no evidence for temporal evolution in the radio can be found during the 5 months of observation. All measurements are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_radio} and listed in Table \ref{tab:at2019fdr_radio}.

From \cite{Reusch2022}.}
%     \labfig{at2019fdr_radio}
% \end{figure}

% To compare to pre-flare host radio emission, we also obtained an archival upper limit from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) \sidecite{Lacy2020}. We exclusively used VLASS, as it is the only survey with sufficient sensitivity and angular resolution to probe AT2019fdr. The quicklook continuum \texttt{fits} file for tile T17t23We was obtained from the archive\sidenote{\url{https://archive-new.nrao.edu/vlass/quicklook}}. The observation was carried out on November 25, 2017 in the \SIrange{2}{4}{\giga\Hz} band. At a significance level of \SI{3}{\sigma}, no emission from the source was detected. The local RMS noise was $\sigma=\SI{0.11}{\milli\jansky}/\text{beam}$, and the beam size was $\SI{2.46}{\arcsecond} \times \SI{2.28}{\arcsecond}$ at a position angle of \SI{-37}{\degree}. This results in an upper limit of \SI{0.32}{\milli\jansky}. A second VLASS observation was taken a few days prior to our second trigger epoch, but the resulting \SI{3}{\sigma} upper limit was less constraining (\SI{0.4}{\milli\jansky}) \cite{Reusch2022}.

% \section{Near-infrared Observations}
% After the detection of the neutrino, we triggered near-infrared (NIR) observations to extend the SED to longer wavelengths. We observed during 4 epochs with WIRC on the Palomar P200 in the \textit{J}-, \textit{H} and \textit{Ks}-band, centered on \SI{1.2}{\micro\m}, \SI{1.6}{\micro\m} and \SI{2.1}{\micro\m}. The dates of observations were July 1 and September 27, 2020, as well as February 2 and May 28, 2021. 

% All WIRC measurements were reduced using a custom pipeline (see \sidecite{De2020}), which performs flat fielding, background subtraction and fits an astrometric solution using \textit{Gaia} DR2. Subsequently, the individual images for each filter and epoch were stacked to increase signal-to-noise. The photometric zero-point calibration of the stacked images was achieved within the pipeline by comparison to the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) \sidecite{Skrutskie2006}.

% \subsection{\texttt{GALFIT} flux extractions}

% As another galaxy lies close to AT2019fdr's host galaxy\todo{distance}, the flux extraction was done manually with \texttt{GALFIT} \sidecite{Peng2002}. This two-dimensional fitting algorithm allows to define different galactic types and components, as well as point sources, and simultaneously fit the science images with these source types. 

% To improve precision, the point spread function\sidenote{See Section \ref{psfphot}} of individual stacked images was first derived with \texttt{photutils} \sidecite{Bradley2020}, a package for the Python astronomy toolkit \texttt{astropy} \sidecite{PriceWhelan2022}. All stars within the surrounding of AT2019fdr were selected for this. From this selection, a subset of stars neither too dim nor too bright were visually selected (see Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_nir_starselection} for an example). Using these stars, the PSF of the image was calculated.

% \begin{figure*}[htb]
%     \includegraphics{at2019fdr/P200_third_epoch_H_stargrid.pdf}
%     \caption[P200 \textit{H}-band star selection]{Exemplary star selection to fit the PSF of the stacked P200/WIRC \textit{H}-band image from Februar 2, 2021. Each cutout comprises $80\times80$ pixels. As can be seen, some of the stars have neighboring stars. As this can hamper a clean extraction of the PSF, they were rejected. All stars included in the PSF extraction are marked with a red rectangle (star 0, 6 and 7). One can also see that during this epoch, observing conditions were not ideal, resulting in horicontally elongated images of the stars.}
%     \labfig{at2019fdr_nir_starselection}
% \end{figure*}

% The stars were automatically retrieved with \texttt{DAOStarFinder}, while PSF fitting was performed with \texttt{EPSFBuilder}. The quality of the extracted PSF was verified by inspecting the residuals of 4 nearby reference stars from SDSS (see Fig \ref{fig:at2019fdr_nir_teststar}). 

% \begin{figure}[htb]
%     \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{at2019fdr/H_3_teststar2.pdf}
%     \caption[P200 \textit{H}-band reference star]{P200 \textit{H}-band reference star. The \texttt{GALFIT} point source model constructed from the image PSF (center) gets subtracted from the science image (left), the residual is shown on the right.}
%     \labfig{at2019fdr_nir_teststar}
% \end{figure}

% The resulting PSF was then ingested into \texttt{GALFIT}. Two Sérsic  profiles describing the galaxy flux as a function of the distance to the galaxy core were then defined\sidenote{For details, see e.g. \cite{Graham2005}.}, centered on the host and the neighboring galaxy location. Additionally, a point source with variable position was used. These were then fit together, resulting in flux values for the host galaxy, the neighboring galaxy and the transient.

% All parameters except for the point source flux were fixed after fitting one epoch (reference epoch). The point source flux was then fit in the remaining three epochs. Unfortunately, the choice of reference epoch had an impact on the point source flux values\sidenote{This can be explained by differing observing conditions at different epochs.}. To account for this variation, both epoch 1 and epoch 4 were used as reference epochs. The difference in the transient flux (when using epoch 1 as reference epoch, and when using epoch 4 as such) was taken as systematic uncertainty on the extracted transient flux \cite{Reusch2022}.

% As there was no image without transient flux available, we added the point source and the host galaxy flux, and then subtracted the synthetic host model\sidenote{See Section \ref{synthetic_host_model}.}. The model-subtracted AB magnitudes calculated by this procedure are shown in Table \ref{tab:p200_nir}.

% \subsection{\textit{WISE} detections}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{at2019fdr/wise.jpg}
%     \caption[The \textit{WISE} satellite]{The \textit{WISE} satellite. Image credit: NASA.}
%     \labfig{wise}
% \end{marginfigure}

% Additionally to the ground-based NIR observations with P200, images from the mid-infrared (MIR) \textit{WISE} satellite were obtained in the \textit{W1}- and \textit{W2}-band (\SI{3.4}{\micro\m} and \SI{4.6}{\micro\m}). \textit{WISE} has cadence of 6 months, and the available images comprised 13 observational epochs prior to the detection of AT2019fdr, as well as 3 epochs during the transient's life.

% As the MIR photometry -- like the NIR photometry -- suffered from blending with the nearby galaxy, forced PSF photometry was used on the co-added images (done with \texttt{ICORE} \sidecite{Masci2013}) of each observational epoch. The package employed for this was \texttt{PythonPhot} \sidecite{Jones2015}, a Python adaptation of the \texttt{DaoPhot} \cite{Stetson1987} algorithms. 

% The root mean square (RMS) of the pre-flare datapoints was only \SI{18}{\micro\jansky}, which was significantly smaller than the peak difference flux, measured at \SI{0.9}{\milli\jansky}. A robust baseline can therefore be constructed from the pre-flare \textit{WISE} detections. 

% \begin{figure}[htb]

%     \labfig{at2019fdr_wise}
% \end{figure}

% \subsection{Synthetic host model} \label{synthetic_host_model}
% As not all measurements from the various instruments had the luxury of readily available reference images for easy extraction of transient light (as is e.g. the case for ZTF), we constructed a synthetic model of the emission from the host galaxy. 

% This was done by fitting a galaxy model as described in \sidecite{Velzen2020}, using different archival measurements: To measure the UV flux, we used images from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (\textit{GALEX}) \sidecite{Martin2005}. The \texttt{gPhoton} \sidecite{Million2016} package with an aperture of \SI{4}{\arcsecond} was used for flux extraction.

% To measure the optical flux, we employed the model magnitudes from SDSS. These are computed either from a de Vaucouleurs galaxy profile, or an exponential galaxy profile (the model mag uses the better of the two fits)\sidenote{See \url{https://www.sdss4.org/dr12/algorithms/magnitudes/mag_model} for details.}.

% We also included the baseline \textit{WISE} datapoints detailed above, as well as an archival infrared measurement from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) \sidecite{Lawrence2007}. Then, the \texttt{prospector} toolkit \sidecite{Johnson2021} was used to sample synthetic galaxy models built by Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (\texttt{FSPS}) \sidecite{Conroy2010}, written in Fortran and employed via the Python wrapper \texttt{python-fsps} \sidecite{ForemanMackey2014}.

%     \labfig{host_model}
% \end{figure}

% The host model was subsequently subtracted from all measurements possibly containing host light within their respective bandpass using \texttt{SNCosmo} \sidecite{Barbary2022}, a Python framework dedicated to supernova analysis.

% \section{SED Blackbody Modeling}
% After compiling and reducing the individual light curve measurements, a physical model motivating the detected light needed to be applied. 

% To explain the SED, we experimented with different models, comprising a single blackbody, a power law, a broken power law\sidenote{I.e. a power law with a break at a certain wavelength where the spectral index suddenly changes.} and two blackbodies. The double blackbody model matched the observations best. In the following, I will detail the derivation of this model and the energy output of the system derived from this, including a discussion of dust extinction.

% \subsection{Fit epochs}
% First, we isolated three regions of interest. These comprised 1) the 20 days between August 5 and 25, 2019, as this windows covers the optical peak of the light curve, as well as the first \textit{WISE} measurement. The second, longer epoch 2) ranged from June 6 to October 8, 2020 (124 days), shortly after the neutrino detection. It covers one \textit{WISE} measurement epoch and two P200 NIR observations. The last epoch 3) covered January 1 to February 26, 2021 (51 days) and contains another P200 NIR observation.

% As the light curve does not significantly change during those epochs, we used the mean flux values for each observed bands as input for the fitting procedure.

% \subsection{Models}
% As stated above, we tried a variety of models:

% \begin{description}
% \item[Unbroken power law] A single, unbroken power law with the power law index as free parameter
% \item[Broken power law] We also used a broken power law, with the two spectral indices and the wavelength of the break as free parameters.
% \item[Single blackbody] A single unmodified blackbody was used here, which can be described by two parameters, the blackbody radius and it temperature.
% \item[Double blackbody] Two unmodified blackbodies, resulting in four free parameters ($2 \times$ temperature, $2 \times$ radius).
% \end{description}

% All fits were performed with the \texttt{lmfit} \sidecite{Newville2021} Python package , which implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for solving non-linear least-squares problems.

% To account for host extinction, we used the \texttt{extinction} \sidecite{Barbary2016} Python package, namely the Calzetti attenuation law \sidecite{Calzetti2000} contained therein. We fixed the extinction $R_V$ at $3.1$ and left $A_V$ free in epoch 1. The best-fit value of $A_V=0.45^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ was fixed in epoch 2 and 3. We decided on using epoch 1 to determine $A_V$, as it provided the best optical and UV coverage of the three epochs. For the double blackbody model, this procedure ultimately resulted in 5 (4) free parameters in epoch 1 (2 and 3).

% We imported the measurements, averaged each the flux in each band per epoch, and passed them to the minimizer (the fit priors are shown in Table \ref{tab:double_bb_priors}).

% \begin{table}
% \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
% Parameter & Initial value & Bounds \\
% \hline
% $A_V$ & $0.45$ & $[0, 2]$\\
% $T_1$ & \SI{1730}{\K} & [\SI{7000}{\K}, \SI{50000}{\K}]\\

% $S_1$ & \num{2.3e23} & [\num{1e20}, \num{1e27}] \\
% $S_2$ & \num{1e20} & [\num{1e18}, \num{1e21}] 
% \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% \caption[Double BB fit priors]{Priors for the double blackbody minimization. $A_V$ is the extinction parameter (only fitted in epoch 1 and fixed for epoch 2 and 3), $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the temperatures of the two blackbodies, while $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the `Scale' parameters (which can be converted into radii.)}
% \label{tab:double_bb_priors}
% \end{table}

% The model for the blackbodies was provided by \texttt{astropy}\sidenote{\texttt{astropy.modeling.models.BackbBody}}. As this model works with a \textit{scale} parameter\sidenote{This \texttt{astropy} terminology is slightly confusing, as the scale has units of spectral radiance (\unit{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm\per\Hz\per\steradian}).} instead of a blackbody radius, this needs to be converted via 

% \begin{equation}
% \text{Scale} = d_L^2 / (r^2 \pi)
% \end{equation}

% where $r$ is the blackbody radius and $d_L$ is the \textit{luminosity distance}, calculated with the redshift $z=0.2666$ and assuming a standard cosmology. The luminosity distance is a measure for how far away something `looks'. If the luminosity $L$ is the total amount of energy isotropically radiated by an object per unit time, it is related to the flux $F$ measured at luminosity distance $d_L$ via this relation (describing an expanding sphere of light):

% \begin{equation}
% d_L = \sqrt{L/4\pi F}
% \end{equation}

% The luminosity distance is equal to the proper distance (as in the amount of space a photon had to traverse to reach us) if and only if the universe is geometrically flat and the universe is static (neither shrinking nor expanding). As the universe in fact \textit{is} expanding, the luminosity distance is similar to the proper distance only for small redshifts (i.e. if there was little time needed for the photon to reach us, and therefore little expansion). In general, the luminosity distance depends on the evolution of the universe. Here, the luminosity distance was calculated with the \texttt{astropy.cosmology} module. 

% \subsection{Minimization}

% \begin{figure*}[htb]

%     \labfig{at2019fdr_lightcurve_and_sed}
% \end{figure*}

% In each iteration of the minization proceess, the spectrum of both blackbodies constructed as such were then reddened, and redshifted. After this, the two blackbody spectra were added. 

% To extract the flux as observed in each band, \texttt{SNCosmo} was used to evaluate all bands given their transmission function. For this, the integrated bandpass library of \texttt{SNCosmo} was used. Bandpasses that were not shipped with the package were added manually from the SVO Filter Profile Service \sidecite{Rodrigo2020}. This was the case for \textit{Swift}, P200 and \textit{WISE}.

% The best fit values from all three epochs, as well as their uncertainties (\SI{68}{\percent} uncertainty level) can be seen in Table \ref{tab:double_bb}. The best-fit temperatures result in a `blue' blackbody peaking in optical/UV wavelengths, and a `red' blackbody peaking in the infrared.

% We derived an optical/UV peak luminosity of $L=\SI[parse-numbers = false]{1.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\times10^{45}}{\erg\per\s}$. By integrating this component over time by scaling it with the shape of the ZTF \textit{g}-band light curve, we obtained a total bolometric luminosity of $E_\text{bol} = \SI{3.4e52}{\erg}$. We did not add the infrared blackbody, as dust absorption was already accounted for by fitting for dust extinction). This pushes AT2019fdr to the class of brightest transients ever detected. Its inferred bolometric energy was almost twice as high as that of ASASSN-15lh, which was one of the brightes transients ever reported \sidecite{Dong2016} and which was suggested to be a TDE \sidecite{Leloudas2016}.

% \subsection{Uncertainty estimate}
% As the fit routine was not able to generate stable covariance matrices in all epochs, the uncertainties were estimated manually.

% For each epoch and fit parameter, this was done by letting all parameters very except for the parameter of interest. This parameter was then varied around the best-fit value, and the resulting $\chi^2$ was evaluated. The $\chi^2$ distribution was then approximated with a polynomial, and the the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence level calculated -- the two parameter values with $\chi^2 - \chi^2_\text{min} = 1$ confine the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence level.

% From the fit parameter uncertainties calculated as such, the uncertainties on the radius and the luminosities was obtained via Gaussian error propagation.

% \label{fig:at2019fdr_contour}
% \end{figure}

% As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:double_bb}, the third epoch saw a temperature rise in the infrared blackbody. As these values were in tension with the dust-echo model discussed below\sidenote{See Section \ref{dust_echo}.}, we investigated this behavior.

% The most likely reason for the higher temperature in epoch 3 is that the infrared blackbody was less constrained in that epoch, as there were no \textit{WISE} measurements available, and the P200 \textit{J}-band extraction resulted in a non-detection. In Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_contour_all}, one can see that all three epochs were compatible within their \SI{90}{\percent} confidence level with a blackbody temperature of \SI{1850}{\K}.

%     \labfig{bb_chisq}
% \end{marginfigure}

% Furthermore, all epochs showed the expected linear correlation between increasing blackbody temperature and decreasing radius of the blackbody. Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_contour_all_nowise} shows how the \SI{90}{\percent} contour of epoch 2 gets moved to a higher temperature and lower radius when removing the two \textit{WISE} datapoints. This reinforces the case that the higher best-fit temperature in epoch 3 is merely an artifact of having less constraints for the fit and not some unexplained physical process.

% \section{Dust Echo Model} \label{dust_echo}
% As one can see in the light curve\sidenote{See Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_light_curve}} of AT2019fdr, the emission in all infrared bands (\textit{WISE} and P200) is delayed with respect to the optical signal. Furthermore, the infrared emission is well approximated by a blackbody, as was shown in the last section.

% We interpret this infrared emission as a \textit{dust echo}. In this model, the X-ray to optical light from the flare is reprocessed by dust. This dust is usually located in a torus around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of the host galaxy \sidecite{Velzen2016}. The high luminosity of the flare causes the dust in the vicinity of the black hole to evaporate, up to a `safe distance', at which the incident flux heats the dust, but not above its sublimation temperature at around \SI{1850}{\K}.

% Outside the sublimation radius, the grain temperature is coupled to the incident radiation, as it cools rapidly ($10^{-4} a_{0.1}^-1T_{1850}^{-5}$ s, which equals to \SI{0.1}{\milli\s} for a grain size of \SI{0.1}{\micro\m} at \SI{1850}{\K}).

% The infrared light curve produced this way can be approximated as follows according to \cite{Velzen2016}:

% \begin{equation}
% L_\text{IR} = \int d\tau~ \Psi(\tau) ~L(t-\tau)
% \end{equation}
% where $L(t)$ is the light curve of an isotropic flare,  $\Psi(\tau)$ is the response function and $\tau$ is the delay. In the case of a spherical dust shell, $\Psi(\tau)$ can be approximated by a square wave response function, ranging from $\tau=0$ to $\tau = 2 R_0 c$ (where $R_0$ is the radius of the dust shell). We can therefore write

% \begin{equation}
% L_\text{IR} = \int d\tau L (t-\tau) ~\Pi (\tau)
% \end{equation}
 
% The delay induced by light travel time can thus be approximated by convolving the optical light curve with a box function of width $2\times\Delta_{t_c}$, where $t_c$ is the light travel time from the transient to the surrounding dust sphere.

% This can be understood if one looks at the geometry of the system. After a delay of $\Delta_{t_c}$, light from the flare reaches the inner edge of the sphere that survives the incident radiation, directly along our line of sight. Here it gets re-emitted in the infrared and reaches us with that initial delay of $cR_0$. Re-emitted light from the side of the system takes even longer. Lastly, re-emitted light from the back of the system reaches us with a delay of $3\times cR_0$ -- first the flare light needs to travel one radius away from us, and then the re-emitted light needs to cross the whole system (twice $R_0$) towards us.

% To calculate $R_0$, we used the ZTF \textit{g}-band light curve as it is the best sampled one. This light curve was then convolved with the box function, where the width of the box function in days was left as free parameter. The initial delay with respect to the optical light curve was then half the size of the box function. The second free parameter was a dimensionless amplitude used to scale the optical light curve to match the amplitude of the \textit{WISE} datapoints.

% Following this procedure, we obtained a best-fit light travel time of 193 days, which translated to $R_0=\SI{0.16}{\parsec}$. The best fit parameters can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_dust_model_chisq}.

% To crosscheck this result, we used the fact that according to \cite{Velzen2016}, the radius of this dust shell can be approximated as 
% \begin{equation}
% R= \bigg(\frac{L_{45}}{a_{0.1}^2 T_{1850}^{5.8}} \bigg)^{1/2} \text{pc}
% \end{equation}
% where $L_{45}$ is the flare's luminosity integrated over all wavelengths where the dust absorbs, normalized to \SI{1e45}{\erg\per\s}, $a_{0.1}$ is the dust grain size normalized to $\SI{0.1}{\micro\m}$, and $T_{1850}$ is the grain temperature normalized to \SI{1850}{\K}.

%     \labfig{at2019fdr_dust_model_chisq}
% \end{figure}

% When inserting the infrared blackbody temperature from the second epoch (as it is the best constrained one) of \SI{1762}{\K}, using the default grain size and the peak optical luminosity of \SI{1.4e45}{\erg\s}, this equation yields a sublimation radius of \SI{0.2}{\parsec}, which is in good agreement with the best-fit value of \SI{0.16}{\parsec}.

% To obtain the covering factor, i.e. the fraction of the shell around the transient that actually contained dust, we needed to derive the total bolometric energy of the dust echo. This was achieved by time-integrating the fitted dust echo light curve, scaled to the peak luminosity of \SI{4.3e44}{\erg\s}. This resulted in a dust echo bolometric energy of \SI{1.1e45}{\erg}. The ratio of the the dust echo bolometric energy to the optical/UV bolometric energy yields a covering factor of 1/3, which was unusually high (TDEs in quiescent galaxies usually have covering factors \SI{\sim 1}{\percent}, see \cite{Velzen2016}).

% We used this covering factor and the radius of the dust shell to determine the dust mass. Again assuming a grain size of \SI{0.1}{\micro\m}, spherical dust grains and a typical dust mass density of \SI{2.5}{\g\per\cm} results in a mass of $0.017 ~\text{M}_\odot$ contributing to the echo. When assuming a typical mass-to-gas ratio of 1:100, this corresponds to $1.7 ~\text{M}_\odot$ in gas.

% % For this work, all values were taken as their default value, and 


% \section{Classification}
% As stated at the beginning of this chapter, AT2019fdr was initially classified as a SLSN IIn, but a subsequent paper classified AT2019fdr as TDE. In this section I will present their reasoning, as well as further evidence we brought forward in favor of this hypothesis, but also some data weakening this interpretation.

% \subsection{Original TDE classification}
% Frederick et al. \cite{Frederick2021} outright rejected the SLSN IIn interpretation, but discussed that AT2019fdr -- as all the 5 flares located in NLSy1 galaxies they studied -- could either be an AGN flare or a TDE. They based their classifications on a set of criteria, detailed in Table \ref{tab:at2019fdr_classification_matrix}. The green cells in the table show that the feature being present (\checkmark) or absent ($\times$) makes a TDE interpretation more likely, while red color means that a flare origin is more likely.

% \label{tab:at2019fdr_classification_matrix}
% \end{table*}

% In the case of AT2019fdr, the host galaxy black hole mass lies below the Hills mass ($\lesssim 10^8 M_\odot$), it was persistently detected in UV around the peak, but initally not in X-ray wavelengths, its \textit{WISE} \textit{W1}-\textit{W2} color was below $0.7~\text{mag}$, and it showed no signs of rebrightening at the time of publication. 

% On the other hand, its narrow H$_\beta$ emission feature and its [OIII]/H$_\beta$ flux ratio, the strong FeII complex and the transients lack of cooling rather stipulated a flare of the underlying NLSy1 host.

% To conclude: A thin majority of features observed in AT2019fdr were `TDE-like'. Also, it resembled PS1-10adi, a bright transient discovered by PS1 on August 1, 2010 \sidecite{Kankare2017}, which has been classified as a TDE embedded in an AGN \sidecite{Jiang2019}. For these reasons, the transient was ultimately classified as TDE. Following the subclassification scheme proposed in \sidecite{Velzen2021a}, it is a H-only TDE, with the FeII complex most likely stemming from the NLSy1 host galaxy.

%     \caption[AT2019fdr rebrightening]{AT2019fdr late stage rebrightening. Starting around MJD $=59500$, the flux in all ZTF bands increased, until it reached a plateau $\sim 200$ days later.}
%     \labfig{at2019fdr_rebrightening}
% \end{figure}

% After the publication of our paper on AT2019fdr, the transient underwent a rebrightening in the optical. About 2.2 years after the optical peak and continuous decline ever since, the flux in all three ZTF bands started to increase again, until it hit a plateau roughly 200 days later. As of April 2023, AT2019fdr is still in this plateau. This is atypical behavior for TDEs and SNe, as was already pointed out in \cite{Frederick2021}. 

% Interestingly, also PS1-10adi showed late-stage rebrightening \cite{Jiang2019}. \todo{what does it mean?}

% \subsection{Additional evidence}
% As shown in Section \ref{x_ray_obs}, AT2019fdr was detected by \textit{SRG}/eROSITA on the first visit with an unusually soft thermal spectrum of \SI[parse-numbers = false]{56^{+32}_{-26}}{\eV}. As AGN spectra are rarely soft \sidecite{Saxton2020}, this can be counted as evidence in favor of the TDE interpration.

% NLSy1 galaxies in general exhibit softer spectra, the temperature of AT2019fdr was atypically low also in this context: It was lower than all NLSy1 temperatures in \sidecite{Leighly1999} and \sidecite{Vaughan1999}. Additionally, SLSNe rarely emit X-ray radiation. Only the first SLSN ever detected, SCP 06F6 \sidecite{Barbary2008}, possibly showed an X-ray flux exceeding AT2019fdr's luminosity \sidecite{Gaensicke2009}.

% The dust echo (see Section \ref{dust_echo}) we found, together with the energy budget and the bolometric evolution suggests that AT2019fdr belongs into an emerging class of strong TDE candidates located in AGN, as e.g. PS1-10adi (discussed above), AT2017gbl \sidecite{Kool2020}, or Arp 299-B AT1 \sidecite{Mattila2018}.

% \section{Chance Coincidence}
% To compute the chance coincidence of observing a TDE comparable to AT2019fdr in spatial and temporal coincidence with a high-energy neutrino, we created a sample of TDEs and candidate TDEs of comparable or higher brightness.

% The sample from which these sources were selected was the full sample of nuclear transients as selected by a filter implemented in \texttt{AMPEL}\sidenote{See Section \ref{ampel}.} This filter required at least 10 detections in both the \textit{g}- and the \textit{r}-band. Additionally, we required a weighted maximum distance of the flare to its host of $\leq \SI{0.5}{\arcsecond}$, and that most datapoints had positive flux after subtraction of the reference image. A detailed discussion of the nuclear filter applied will be provided in the next chapter.\todo{ref} 

% We restricted the dataset to transients first detected after January 1, 2018 to ensure that all of them had high-quality reference images. We also required the transients to have peaked before July 2020; 3172 flare candidates remained after these cuts.

% We further required that the transients were not classified as variable stars, or bogus objects. Additionally, their rise (fade) $e$-folding time was required to exceed the uncertainty on this parameter. At this stage, 1628 candidates remained.

% As only candidates with brightness comparable to or higher than AT2019fdr were of interest, we required their peak apparent magnitude $\leq$ AT2019fdr's peak apparent magnitude; this left 157 transients. To select candidate TDE and accretion flares, we required the rise (fade) $e$-folding time to lie in a [15,80] ([30,500]) day interval, which left 25 transients.

% Lastly, we excluded those transients from the sample of 25 transients which were spectroscopically classified as supernovae, or were ruled out as short-timescale AGN variability by visual inspection. We also excluded candidates which displayed no consistent color or color evolution post peak, or which had a non-smooth light curve evolution post peak. This left a final sample of 12 transients. 

% We then calculated the effective source density $\rho_\text{eff}$ -- i.e. the density of sources per \unit{\square\deg} of sky in the survey footprint at any given time -- as follows:

% \begin{equation}
% \rho_\text{eff} = (N_\text{flare} \times \Delta t_\text{flare}) / (A_\text{ZTF}  \times \Delta t_\text{search})
% \end{equation}
% where $N_\text{flare}$ is the total number of comparable sources (including AT2019dsg and AT2019fdr), $\Delta t_\text{flare}$ is the typical duration of such events, $A_\text{ZTF}$ is the sky area accessible to ZTF, excluding sources with a galactic latitude $|b|<\SI{7}{\degree}$, and $\Delta t_\text{search}$ is the time range of the sources sample, i.e. 2.5 years. With the 12 events of the comparison sample, the effective source density is $\rho_\text{eff} = \SI{1.71e-4}{\deg}^{-2}$.

% Now an expectation value for the number of neutrinos coincident with two sources can be calculated as $\mu=\rho_\text{eff}\times A_\text{IC}$, where $A_\text{IC}$ is the summed \SI{90}{\percent} uncertainty area of the alert neutrinos we followed up. This was \SI{154.33}{\square\deg} at that time, which resulted in $\mu=0.026$. Employing a Poisson distribution, the probability of finding two sources by chance was $p(2)=\num{3.4e-4}$, while finding one source only had a p-value of $p(1)=\num{2.6e-2}$ \cite{Reusch2022}.

% To obtain the probability of finding two neutrinos coincident by chance, we calculated the probability of observing 0 and 1 coincidences, and subtracted these from 1 -- which leaves the probability of observing 2 or more coincidences:

% \begin{equation}
% p(2) = 1 - \sum_{k=0}^1 \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^k}{k!}
% \end{equation}
% where the sum is the cumulative distribution function of the Poisson distribution. Using a right-tailed normal distribution, $p(2)=\num{3.4e-4}$ translates to $\SI{3.4}{\sigma}$ (\SI{1.94}{\sigma} for a single association).

% We have so far detailed the data reduction for AT2019fdr, established that it likely was a TDE -- albeit an unusual one -- modeled its SED and the dust echo we discovered, calculated its energy output and showed that a chance coincidence of two high-energy neutrinos with sources comparable to AT2019fdr is quite improbable.

% We now need to evaluate if there are models that render AT2019fdr capable of producing the observed high-energy neutrino, and . This will be done in the next section.

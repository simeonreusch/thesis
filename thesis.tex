\chapter{The IceCube Detector}
\labch{IceCube}
One of the two most relevant instruments for this thesis is the \textit{IceCube Detector}, a neutrino detector located at the geographic South Pole. It is the successor to the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) at the same location \sidecite{Andres1999, Andres2000}. 
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic_cherenkov1.pdf}
    \includegraphics{ic_cherenkov2.pdf}
    \caption[Cherenkov radiation]{The principle of Cherenkov radiation. In the upper figure Cherenkov radiation is emitted, as the radiation emitted at different points in time forms mutual wavefronts. In the figure on the bottom, all radiation is cancelled out by destructive interference (all circles are subsets of the first on the left, as the particle is not moving faster than light in the medium). Adopted from \cite{LAnnunziata2020}.}
    \labfig{cherenkov}
\end{marginfigure}
The basic oeprational principle of IceCube (and already of AMANDA) is the detection of Cherenkov light within the antarctic ice. When charged secondary particles created by neutrino interactions travel through the ice, their speed exceeds the phase velocity of light in ice and they emit Cherenkov radiation. The detector consists of 5160 individual digital optical modules (DOMs), buried deep in the ice. These are sensitive to the Cherenkov radiation.

\section{Cherenkov radiation} \label{cherenkov_radiation}

Cherenkov radation was first detected in 1934 by Soviet scientist Pavel Cherenkov \sidecite{Cherenkov1934}. It occurs when charged particles travel within a medium with a velocity exceeding the speed of light in that medium. The refractive index in a medium is defined as $n=\frac{c_0}{c_m}$, where $c_m$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $c_m$ is the phase velocity of light in that medium. Note that the phase velocity of light in a medium can exceed $c_0$, so $n<1$ is possible. 

When charged particles cross an electrically neutral dielectric medium, atoms along the particle's path are briefly polarized and emit electromagnetic radiation. 

For slow particles, this radiation destructively interferes with itself, canceling out all signals (see the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig:cherenkov}). Now, if the particle is travelling faster than speed of light within the medium $c_m$, this destructive interference does not happen. Rather, a cone-shaped wavefront gets created (see top panel of Fig. \ref{fig:cherenkov}). This wavefront constitutes Cherenkov radiation. If the particle has speed $v=\beta c_0$, the angle $\theta$ between the particle trajectory and the direction of the Cherenkov radiation can be calculated as \sidecite{LAnnunziata2020}:

\begin{equation}
\cos{\theta} = \frac{\beta}{n}
\end{equation}

For example: If the medium is ice, to first order the refractive index $n\approx1.31$.\sidenote{This is of course rather crude. The $n$ of Antarctic glacial ice depends e.g. on depth; a fact we will come back to later when discussing directional reconstruction of high-energy IceCube neutrinos.} A secondary muon traveling through the ice at $0.999\,c_0$ will therefore emit Cherenkov light at an angle of $\theta = \cos^{-1}{\big(\frac{0.999}{1.31}\big)} \approx \SI{40}{\degree}$. 
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic_cherenkov_spectrum.pdf}
    \caption[Cherenkov spectrum]{Cherenkov spectrum for a particle with $v=0.8 \,c_0$ in water. The intensity peaks at $\SI{4e15}{\Hz}$, corresponding to a wavelength of \SI{75}{\nm}, lying at the high-frequency end of the UV spectrum. Adopted from \cite{Fulop1992}.}
    \labfig{cherenkov_spectrum}
\end{marginfigure}
Cherenkov radiation does not have spectral peaks, but is continuous, with a relative intensity proportional to the frequency. Note that the refractive index of a medium is also frequency dependent, dropping below 1 in the X-ray. From this it follows that Cherenkov radiation appears blue to the human eye (the high-frequency part dominates) and peaks in the ultra violet (UV), before it sharply drops off in the X-ray regime \sidecite{Fulop1992}, see Fig. \ref{fig:cherenkov_spectrum}.

\section{IceCube instrumentation}

IceCube detects neutrinos by observing the optical part of their secondary particle Cherenkov spectrum (see section \ref{cherenkov_radiation} above). To understand how this is done, one first needs to look at the working principe of a photomultiplier tube (PMT).

\subsection*{Photomultiplier tubes}
A PMT is a device used to detect very faint light signals by amplifying them. They consist of vacuum tubes and were successfully realized for the first time in the 1930s \sidecite{Iams1935}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics{ic_pmt_annotated.pdf}
    \caption[PMT schematic]{A photomultiplier tube. Adopted from \cite{Bednarski2014}.}
    \labfig{pmt}
\end{figure}

As one can see in Fig. \ref{fig:pmt}, there are three principal components: a \textit{cathode}, a number of \textit{dynodes} and an \textit{anode}. When photons hit the cathode, they can release electrons via the photoelectric effect \sidecite{Einstein1905}. These photoelectrons are then accelerated (towards the right side in Fig. \ref{fig:pmt}) by an electric field within the tube. This field is generated by applying a high voltage between the cathode and the anode.

To amplify the signal, a number of dynodes is placed in between. These are additional electrodes with subsequently higher voltages. When the photoelectron hits the first dynode, a number of secondary electrons are generated, which are then accelerated towards the next dynode by the electric field. This process repeats for every dynode, generating an avalanche of electrons exponentially amplifying the original single photoelectron signal. The number of secondary electrons hitting the anode is proportional to the number of incident photons, resulting in a linear detector response (as long as the detector stays below its saturation level) \sidecite{Wright2017}.

IceCube uses PMTs made by Hamamatsu Photonics (R7081-02), sensitive to photons between \SI{300}{\nm} and \SI{650}{\nm}. They have a quantum efficiency at \SI{390}{\nm} of $25\%$, are operated with a voltage of \SI{1500}{\V} and have a gain of \num{e7}. The photon-sensitive surface area is typically \SI{530}{\cm\squared} \sidecite{Abbasi2010}.

\subsection*{The Digital Optical Module} \label{DOM}
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic_DOM.png}
    \caption[IceCube digital optical module]{The IceCube DOM seen from the side. The detecting side of the PMT is facing downwards, with the main board an the PMT base board on top. From \cite{Aartsen2017}.}
    \labfig{ic_dom}
\end{marginfigure}
The individual IceCube PMTs for detecting the Cherenkov radiation are enclosed in \textit{digital optical modules} (DOMs). Each DOM consists of a pressure-resistant glass sphere, several controller boards and the PMT, facing downward (see Fig. \ref{fig:ic_dom}). The glass sphere can withstand long-term pressure of \SI{250}{\bar}. The optical transmission of the spheres was measured to be $93\%$ at \SI{400}{\nm}, decreasing to $10\%$ at \SI{315}{\nm}.

The circular main board hosts data acquisition and control, as well as units for communication, calibration and a power converter. Another board interfaces with the PMT, while additional boards delay the PMT signals, generate the high voltage current powering the PMT, as well as control calibration light emitting diodes (LEDs) that generate light flashes which can be received by neighboring DOMs for calibration purposes \sidecite{Aartsen2017}.
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic_DOM_connections.pdf}
    \caption[IceCube DOM connections]{Connection scheme for four IceCube DOMs along one string. Pairs of DOMs share one twisted-pair cable. Also, each DOM is directly connected to its direct neighbor above and below. Adopted from \cite{Aartsen2017}.} 
    \labfig{ic_dom_connections}
\end{marginfigure}
Because of data storage restrictions, the DOMs only record the full digitized waveform data after a ``hit''. A hit is triggered when also DOMs above and below the DOM in question (to be precise, the neighbors and the next-to-nearest neighbors) report a coincident signal above a certain threshold \cite{Aartsen2017}. To fully record the waveform after a hit, there needs to be some kind of buffer. This is realized with the delay board, which routes the analog PMT signal through a \SI{10}{\m} long, serpentine copper trace to delay it by \SI{75}{\nm}.

The DOMs are connected to the IceCube Laboratory (ICL) with twisted-pair copper cables. The power for the DOM is also transmitted with this cable. Two DOMs share one twisted-pair cable, and each DOM is also directly connected to its two neighbors on the same string (to detect hits, i.e. locally coincident signals).

The flasher board houses 12 LEDs operating at \SI{\sim400}{\nm} wavelength. These are used to verify the DOM timing response, to measure the DOM in-ice position, to determine the optical properties of the ice, and to verify the reconstruction algorithms \cite{Aartsen2017}.

\subsection*{Detector layout}
In total, approximately 5800 DOM units were built and tested, 300 failing tests and the rest being delivered to the South Pole. The vast majority of these were ultimately deployed (5160 in total). The final detector layout (since the last drilling campaign 2010/2011, see below) consists of 86 strings. The DOMs were deployed along those strings, like pearls on a necklace. Each string contains 60 DOMs.



\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{ic_side_view_font.pdf}
    \caption[IceCube side-on]{Side view of the IceCube detector, showing the instrumented array deep in the antarctic glacial ice. In the center on top is the IceCube Laboratory, were data acquisition takes place. From \cite{Ahlers2018a}.}
    \labfig{ic_sideon}
\end{figure}
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic_top_view.pdf}
    \caption[IceCube top-down view]{Top-down view of the IceCube detector, spanning \SI{1}{\square\km} on the surface. Adopted from \cite{Ahlers2018a}.}
    \labfig{ic_top_down}
\end{marginfigure}
The instrumented part of the strings starts at \SI{1450}{\m} below surface, with one DOM every \SI{17}{\m} to a depth of \SI{2450}{\m}, just above the bedrock at a depth of \SI{2820}{\m}. In Fig. \ref{fig:ic_sideon} the layout of the in-ice array can be seen. The strings follow a roughly hexagonal layout (see Fig. \ref{fig:ic_top_down}), with a side length of \SI{1}{\km\squared}. The total instrumented volume of glacial ice is thus \SI{1}{\km\cubed} \cite{Aartsen2017}. Of the 5160 deployed DOMs, 92 are dead as of March 2023, a loss of $1.7\%$\sidenote{This is better than the predicted failure percentage, which was projected to be $2\%$ by 2023 \cite{Aartsen2017}.}.


\subsection*{Deployment}
As one can imagine, embedding the DOMs within the ice was a non-trivial task. It required drilling 86 boreholes with a diameter\sidenote{The hole diameter was larger than the DOM diameter (\SI{35}{\cm}) to account for partial refreezing of the bore hole.} of roughly \SI{60}{\cm} and a length of \SI{2500}{\m}. This was achieved over several drilling campaigns with the Enhanced Hot Water Drill (EHWD) specifically built for this task. This drill had a total power of \SI{5}{\mega\W} and was able to drill with a maximum speed of \SI{2.2}{\meter\per\minute}. With these performance characteristics, one hole was drilled every \SI{48}{\hour} on average \cite{Aartsen2017} (drill operation happened around the clock). It took 7 drilling seasons to deploy the final IceCube86 setup, from the Antarctic summers 2004/2005 to 2010/2011. Fig. \ref{fig:ic_drill} shows the tower operations site directly above the bore hole \sidecite{Benson2014}.

The water for drilling the holes was heated to \SI{88}{\celsius} with 35 water heaters working in parallel, each providing \SI{125}{\kilo\W} power. The average amount of fuel used per drill hole was \SI{27000}{\liter} \cite{Benson2014}.

    \labfig{ic_drill}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{The IceTop surface array}
One of the major classes of background events are cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, as the muons generated in these are indiscernible from neutrino-induced muons within the in-ice array. IceTop serves as a partial veto against these.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic_icetop.pdf}
    \caption[IceTop detector]{IceCube IceTop surface Cherenkov detector tank. From \cite{Abbasi2013}.}
    \labfig{ic_icetop}
\end{marginfigure}

The detector array consists of $2\times81$ ice-filled Cherenkov tanks. These are placed in pairs on the same hexagonal grid as the DOM strings for the in-ice array. Each tank is equipped with two IceCube DOMs (see \nameref{DOM} above) \sidecite{Abbasi2013}.\todo{more detail}.

\subsection*{Data acquisition}
As noted above, only for locally coincident hits in multiple detectors the full waveforms are digitized by the DOMs. These are then sent to the IceCube Lab on the surface via the twisted-pair cable datalink, were they are ingested into the data acquisition system (DAQ). Hits throughout the detector are investigated by the system to establish common causility by temporal and sometimes spatial patterns. All hits for which common causality can be established form an \textit{event}. The rate of these events varies seasonally with the atmospheric muon flux, with a median event rate of \SI{2.7}{\kilo\Hz} and a total data rate of \SI{1}{\tera\byte\per\day} (roughly \SI{100}{\mega\bit\per\second}) \cite{Aartsen2017}.

As satellite bandwidth is limited and costly, further software triggers on-site reduce the data rate to $15\%$ of the initial rate. These events are then transmitted via satellite to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for further analysis. The full event stream is also written to redundant disks, which are transferred twice per year to Madison.

\subsection*{Time synchronization}
As timing information is crucial for event constitution and reconstruction (more on that later), all DOMs need to be synced to a common clock. This is achieved by syncing the whole system to a Symmetricom ET6000 GPS receiver. The synchronization of individual DOMs is performed while data transfer is paused.

This is achieved with Reciprocal Active Pulsing (RAPcal): A bipolar pulse is initiated on the surface and sent to the DOM. The sender saves the local time when it sends the pulse and starts a timer. Upon reception down the string, the DOM also saves its current local time, saves the received pulse waveform, starts a timer, responds with a bipolar pulse of its own and stops the timer. Upon reception, the surface station stops its timer and requests the received pulse waveform and all timing information from the DOM.

With these six pieces of information -- the two transmit timestamps, the two receive timestamps and both waveforms -- a transformation from the GPS-synchronized surface to local DOM time domain and vice versa can be calculated, with a precision of \SIrange{1}{2}{\ns} \sidecite{Abbasi2009}.

\section{IceCube Reconstruction}
The goal of IceCube reconstruction is twofold: Reconstruction the deposited neutrino energy, and reconstructing the neutrino arrival direction. The events seen by the detector can be broadly classified into two categories: \textit{Track events} and \textit{cascade events}.

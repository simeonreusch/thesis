\chapter{The ZTF Follow-Up Pipeline} 
\labch{fupipeline}
After introducing the IceCube detector (see chapter \ref{ic}) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (see chapter \ref{ztf}), we now have all the ingredients to introduce the ZTF high-energy neutrino follow-up pipeline.

IceCube sends out \num{\sim2.2} astrophysical high-energy neutrino alerts on average per month (see section \ref{ic_alerts}). Due to its large FoV and fully robotic operation, ZTF is the ideal follow-up instrument for these alerts. The typically reported IceCube localization regions can be covered with only one pointing of the telescope.

The follow-up procedure can be outlined as follows: An \textit{IceCube alert} is received. If the alert meets our \textit{alert quality criteria}, we do an \textit{observability check}. If the sky region is accessible to ZTF, we \textit{observe}. After observations, we \textit{filter} candidates with \texttt{AMPEL} \sidecite{Nordin2019}, followed by visual inspection and -- if needed -- trigger \textit{additional follow-up}.

\section{Alert cuts}\label{alert_cuts}
As we only have limited telescope time, we apply quality cuts on the high-energy neutrino alerts received via GCN. As outlined in section \ref{ic_event_selection}, there are two alert streams: \textit{Gold alerts} with an average purity of \SI{50}{\percent} (\SI{36}{\percent} of all non-retracted alerts), and \textit{bronze alerts} with an average purity of \SI{30}{\percent} (\SI{64}{\percent}).

In general, we only follow up if the reported rectangular \SI{90}{\percent} uncertainty region is smaller than \SI{40}{\square\deg}. All gold alerts making this cut qualify for follow up. There is a more stringent cut on the uncertainty area of bronze alerts, requiring these are $<\SI{10}{\square\deg}$.

\section{Observation planning with \texttt{planobs}}\label{planobs}
If an alert makes the cut, one needs to check if observations with ZTF are feasible. To reduce the potential for errors, this is done with assistance by the \texttt{planobs} \sidecite{Reusch2023} tool, developed mainly by the author to automate the task as much as possible.

\texttt{planobs} is written in Python, and is deployed on a virtual private server. The backend runs on \texttt{Flask}\sidenote{\url{https://flask.palletsprojects.com}} behind a \texttt{nginx}\sidenote{\url{https://nginx.com}} reverse proxy and serves a Slack\sidenote{\url{https://slack.com/}} bot integrated into the DESY multimessenger group chat.

The tool is constructed to be used with a simple command-line-style interface in the Slack chat. For example, 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,style=kaolstplain]
Plan IC221223A -multiday
\end{lstlisting}
will create an observation plan for IceCube high-energy neutrino IC220501A, spanning multiple days.

To obtain the positional and error information on the neutrino in question from the respective GCN circular, \texttt{planobs} is searching for the GCN on an experimental server\sidenote{\url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/wsgi-scripts/tach/gcn_v2/tach.wsgi}}. As notices are written by humans, it fuzzily parses them to extract the relevant information. After this, observability at Mt. Palomar is calculated, defaulting to the current time (optionally, a desired observation time can be requested). 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics{fu/planobs_airmass.pdf}
    \caption[Observation plan]{Observation plot created by \texttt{planobs} for the follow-up of IceCube neutrino IC221223A. The altitude and airmass of the alert region at Mt. Palomar are shown in blue. The red and green shaded regions are proposed observation windows in the \textit{r}- and \textit{r}-band. The red arrows show the airmass limit of 2.0, and the moon is displayed as yellow dotted curve. The gray shaded region marks night-time at the telescope site. All information automatically extracted from the GCN circular are shown on top.}
    \labfig{planobs}
\end{figure}
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{fu/planobs_grid.pdf}
    \caption[\texttt{planobs} ZTF grid]{The \SI{90}{\percent} uncertainty rectangle of IC221223A overlayed onto the ZTF grid.}
    \labfig{planobs_grid}
\end{marginfigure}
An example observability plot is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:planobs}. The blue curve shows the altitude of the sky region in question above Mt. Palomar, and the red and green shaded regions mark the two proposed observation windows in the \textit{r}- and the \textit{g}-band.

Additionally, for each field within the primary and secondary grid (see section \ref{ztf_grid}) that have overlap with the uncertainty region\sidenote{There is an additional check to ensure the fields have reference images available, see section \ref{ztf_image_subtraction}.}, the coverage is calculated and the field with the highest coverage is selected. Fig. \ref{fig:planobs_grid} shows such an overlay plot for IC221223A and ZTF field 693.

If the plan looks good, one needs to invoke
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,style=kaolstplain]
Plan IC221223A -trigger
\end{lstlisting} 
to submit the observation request via a dedicated API to the telescope scheduler. There is additional functionality to ensure that the trigger has been added to the telescope queue. If all goes well and weather permits, the observations are carried out, and candidate vetting can begin.

As we are interested in the evolution of potential source candidates, usually observations within a \SI{10}{\day} window are triggered. To obtain deep images during the first night, we trigger \SI{300}{\second} exposures in the \textit{g}- and \textit{r}-band in the first night. These are followed by shallower \SI{30}{\second} observations in the \textit{g}-band during nights 2, 3, 5 and 7, and finally shallow observations in both \textit{g}- and \textit{r}-band during night 9.

\section{The \texttt{AMPEL} broker}
The next step in the pipeline is the selection of good candidates. ZTF typically serves 200000 alerts per night. As only a fraction of those is relevant for the neutrino follow up, we need software to cut down the number of alerts. This is exactly what AMPEL is doing, a streaming data analysis framework developed at Humboldt-University Berlin and DESY Zeuthen.

The main design goals of \texttt{AMPEL} comprise scalability, modularity and provenance tracking. It was built with the data rate of future Rubin observatory \sidecite{Ivezic2019} in mind, and was subsequently selected as one of 7 brokers\sidenote{See \url{https://www.lsst.org/scientists/alert-brokers}.} for Rubin observatory. The complete software stack is written in Python.

    \includegraphics{fu/ampel_design.pdf}
    \caption[\texttt{AMPEL} overview]{Overview of the \texttt{AMPEL} data processing. Alerts from DiRAC are ingested into \texttt{AMPEL}, where they are processed, combined, analyzed and served to science consumers. From \cite{Nordin2019}}
    \labfig{ampel_design}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:ampel_design} shows the design and information flow of \texttt{AMPEL}. On the top, data from Mt. Palomar is transmitted to IPAC (see section \ref{ztf_data_link}), where detections are extracted from the difference images. These are then sent to the Institute for Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics \& Cosmology (DiRAC) at the University of Washington, where they are distributed via parallel Kafka streams. This is the live data stream \texttt{AMPEL} listens to.

The first of several execution layers (\textit{tiers}) is the \textbf{Filtering} stage (Tier 0). Here different filters can be implemented, reducing the large number of alerts by different criteria (e.g. \texttt{RealBogus} and \texttt{sgscore} (see section \ref{ztf_image_subtraction}), color evolution, host galaxy properties, (non-) existence of detection history). All alerts surviving the filtering stage are then stored in a database (\texttt{MongoDB}\sidenote{\url{https://mongodb.com}}) collection. Additionally, processing states are also stored in another collection.

\textbf{Tier 1} can be skipped here, as it serves technical purposes. The next relevant stage is the \textbf{analysis} stage (Tier 2). In this,

% \labch{Neutrino Astronomy}

% For millennia, astronomy was exclusively the domain of optics. Until the \nth{17} century, the unaided eye, sensitive to wavelengths from \num{380} to \SI{800}{\nano\m}, was the sole `instrument' \sidecite{Wall2018} in observing the sky.

% Astronomy started with observing and predicting the motions of the sun to forecast seasons in ancient Babylon and Egypt\sidenote{In Egypt, the seasons were not particularly prominent, so their practice of tracking the sun relative to Sirius, the brightest star visible, to predict the Nile flooding had a direct impact on people's livelihood.} \sidecite{Linton2004}. Over the centuries, observing the sky evolved into a mature science, ultimately leading to the Copernican Revolution that placed the sun instead of the Earth at the center of the solar system. This pre-instrumental period also already saw the observation of galactic transient events, like the supernova (SN) SN185 by Chinese astronomers or the widely observed SN1054.

% Astronomy was greatly accelerated by the invention of the telescope by Hans Lippershey, which allowed for the observation of much fainter objects \sidecite{Beckman2021}. Radio and infrared astronomy expanded the observational means to higher wavelengths in the 1930s and 1950s, while UV, X-ray and Gamma-ray astronomy required satellites to escape the absorption of high-energy photons by the Earth's atmosphere or -- in the case of very-high-energy Gamma rays -- required the development of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs).

% Two important developments in the \nth{19} century further advanced the field: Spectroscopy, allowing the identification of chemical elements in extraterrestrial objects, and photography, which vastly increased the depth of observations by accumulating much more light with the telescope as is possible by eye alone.

% After the invention of the telescope, it took another 360 years for the photon to lose its supremacy as the only messenger available. The advent of neutrino astronomy in the 1960s and lastly, gravitational wave astronomy in the 2010s changed that and initiated the era of \textit{multimessenger astronomy}.

% Besides those messengers, the early \nth{20} century saw the identification of another potential messenger: Cosmic rays, which are largely highly energetic protons, electrons and helium nuclei. This messenger though comes with a large drawback: Due to their charge, the particles constituting cosmic rays are deflected by magnetic fields on their way through interstellar and intergalactic space, which makes pin-pointing their origin a very hard task \cite{Beckman2021}. 

% Contrary to photons -- especially optical ones -- neutrinos are extremely hard to detect, explaining why neutrino astronomy is such a recent development. As this thesis is concerned with the identification of the astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos, this chapter will detail what neutrinos are, how high-energy neutrino astronomy advanced, and which types of objects and events have been proposed as sources of high-energy neutrinos. 

% \section{Neutrinos}
% Neutrinos were first predicted by Pauli in the 1930s \sidecite{Giunti2007}, given firm theoretical footing by Fermi in 1934 \sidecite{Fermi1934}, and experimentally detected by Reines and Cowan in 1955 \sidecite{Reines1956}.

% \subsection{The neutrino hypothesis} \label{neutrino_hypothesis}
% Wolfgang Pauli proposed the neutrino as a remedy for the continuous $\beta$-spectrum of decaying uranium. It was discovered that when nuclear elements decay, they emit different particles. Their types of emission were dubbed $\alpha$-, $\beta$- and $\gamma$ radiation; the first being helium-4 nuclei, the second electrons or protons, and lastly energetic photons. Contrary to $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-radiation, the spectrum of $\beta$-radiation turned out to be continuous, while one would expect sharp energy levels for the emitted particles.\todo{Überprüfen.}

%     \labfig{pauli_letter}
% \end{marginfigure}

% In $\beta$-decay, the nucleus of an atom emits an electron when undergoing the nuclear transition $(A,Z)\rightarrow(A,Z+1) + e^-$. In this scenario, the decay is a two body problem (nucleus and electron), where the emitted electron carries the (quantized) energy lost to the nucleus due to its transition to the final state. As it was known already then, this tight distribution of energy is fixed -- so one would expect a narrow energy spectrum for the emitted electron, as was the case for $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-radiation. But the observed electron spectrum was continuous, hence the puzzlement of the community. Bohr proposed loosening the requirement of energy conservation -- a suggestion Pauli was strongly opposed to\sidenote{He brought forth a though experiment of a closed box, within which $\beta$-decay happens. This box would change weight over time, a result which he deemed paradoxical.} \sidecite{Jensen2000}.

% Pauli instead took refuge in what he considered a desperate solution, and suggested that the $\beta$-decay was in fact a \textit{three body problem}, with a neutral particle carrying parts of the released energy \sidecite{Bilenky2012}. This would explain the continous electron spectrum. He also assumed that the hypothetical second particle reacted extremely rarely, which could explain why it had not been observed yet.

% The next advancement was due to Enrico Fermi in 1934. By then, the picture of the nucleus had been complemented by the neutron, discovered by James Chadwick two years earlier. Fermi built the first theory of $\beta$-decay in analogy to the description of the emission of photons from excited nuclei \cite{Fermi1934}. \todo{Läuft die über Energielevels?}. He assumed that the electron-neutrino pair is produced when a neutron within the nucleus (which had recently been discovered) transitions into a proton: $n \rightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu}$. The predictions from his theory were in fair agreement with observations, provided the neutrino mass was very small \cite{Fermi1934}.

% \subsection{Neutrino detections}
% It took another 22 years until the neutrino was discovered experimentally. In the meantime, the atomic bomb had been proposed, built, and used twice. As part of the effort to develop a fission bomb, the Savannah River Plant nuclear reactor was constructed. On a more pacifistic note, Reines and Cowan used the hypothesized flux of neutrinos from this reactor to first experimentally detect a neutrino \cite{Reines1956} (later confirmation in \sidecite{Cowan1956}).

% The process used by them was the inverse beta decay, by which the predicted neutrino (in fact, an electron antineutrino) could react with a proton, converting it to a neutron and releasing a positron ($\bar{\nu_e} + p \rightarrow n + e^+$). The released positron then annihilates with a free electron within the target material (for which they used $\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CdCl}_2$), releasing two \SI{511}{\kilo\eV} photons in the process, emitted in opposite directions due to momentum conservation. These were then be detected by a liquid scintillator surrounding the target. The neutron diffuses through the target medium for a while until being captured by the cadmium, emitting a delayed photon signal (see Fig. \ref{fig:neutrino_discovery}).

% \begin{figure}[htb]
%     \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{theory/neutrino_discovery_principle.png}
%     \caption[Neutrino discovery schematic]{Experimental setup for the discovery of the neutrino. From \cite{Reines1956}.}
%     \labfig{neutrino_discovery}
% \end{figure}

% The extremely low interaction rate, or in other words, the small interaction cross section of the neutrino, required large amounts of target material and liquid scintillator to detect this reaction \cite{Giunti2007}. Ultimately and thanks to the unique event signature detailed above, Reins and Cowan succeeded, reporting a neutrino detection rate of $2.88 \pm 0.22$ counts/hour \cite{Reines1956}.

% \subsection{Discovery of the muon neutrino}
% Another important step was the discovery of the \textit{muon neutrino}: At the Brookhaven National Lab in the US, muons and Kaons from an accelerator were used to prove the existence of this neutrino flavor. Prior to the experiment, it had already been pointed out by Lee and Yang that the experimental non-detection of the decay $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ strongly hinted at the existence of a muon neutrino. This decay is only allowed if there is no difference between $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ \sidecite{Ekspong1993}.

% The goal of the Brookhaven experiment was to directly detect the muon neutrino by producing $\pi^+$ through bombarding a Beryllium target with \SI{15}{\giga\eV} protons. These $\pi^+$ nearly all decay to $\mu^+ \nu_\mu$\sidenote{The channel $\pi^+ \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_e$ is strongly suppressed, see \cite{Bilenky2012}.}. In a subsequent decay channel, almost all $\mu^+$ decay, only allowing the muon neutrinos to pass. These were sent to a neutrino detector, consisting of aluminum plates located in a spark chamber. The neutrinos would interact with the nuclei in the aluminum and produce charged leptons. If there was no difference between $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_e$, one would expect detecting $e^-$ and $\mu^-$ in virtually equal numbers. But the experiment detected 29 muons, and the 6 detected electrons could be attributed to background. This proved the existence of the muon neutrino \sidecite{Danby1962}.


% \subsection{The solar neutrino problem}

% The neutrino was successfully detected. This, combined with the prediction that the process of nuclear fission within the sun should release neutrinos, triggered the question of detecting solar neutrinos. The sun creates neutrinos both via the $pp$ chain and the CNO cycle, in both processes converting four protons and two electrons into a $^4\text{He}$ nucleus and two electron neutrinos: $4p + 2e^- \rightarrow  ~^4\text{He} + 2\nu_e + \SI{26.7}{\mega\eV}$. The energy is then released via photons or via neutrinos carrying kinetic energy \cite{Giunti2007}.

% \begin{marginfigure}

%     \caption[Solar neutrino flux measured by SNO]{The solar neutrino flux as measured by SNO. The x-axis shows the $\nu_e$ flux, while the y-axis shows the flux of solar $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$. The intersection point shows the best-fit flux values for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu,\tau}$, with a resulting flavor ratio of $\sim 1/3$ for all types. From \cite{Ahmad2002}.}
%     \labfig{sno_flux}
% \end{marginfigure}

% Solar electron neutrinos were first detected in the 1960s in the Homestake experiment by Davis. He operated a tank located underground in the Homestake mine, filled with \SI{380}{\meter\cubed} of tetrachloroethene, which allowed antineutrino capture via $\nu_e +~ ^{37}\text{Cl} \rightarrow ~ ^{37}\text{Ar}^+ + e^-$. First results after 150 days of data taking resulted in an upper neutrino flux limit much lower than the theoretical expectations \sidecite{Davis1968}. The experiment would run continously from 1970 to 1994, detecting a neutrino flux about $1/2-1/3$ of the expected flux. The fact that the measured flux was consistently lower than the predicted one, despite various checks and improvements, became known as the \textit{solar neutrino problem} \sidecite{Bahcall1976}.

% A solution to the solar neutrino was first proposed by Gribov and Pontecorvo in 1969 \sidecite{Gribov1969}: The missing electron neutrinos from the sun could have oscillated into neutrinos of a different flavor while traveling to Earth. This proposed neutrino oscillation was shown by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in 2002; evidence for the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos was already brought forth four years earlier by the Super-Kamiokande detector \sidecite{Fukuda1998}. The SNO detector was sensitive to two types of interactions: One channel in which only $\nu_e$ could participate, and one open to neutrinos of all flavors. It was determined that the flux of solar $\nu_e$ \sidenote{The existence of the tau neutrino had been confirmed one year earlier by the \textit{Direct Observation of the Nu Tau} (DONUT) experiment \cite{Kodama2001}.} was $1/3$ of the total neutrino flux (consisting of $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$). This result was in full agreement with theoretical predictions for the solar neutrinos flux, and directly showed that neutrinos do oscillate \sidecite{Ahmad2002}.

% These oscillations can be described by the $3x3$ unitary transformation matrix known as the \textit{Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata} (PMNS) matrix, that works analogous to the matrix describing the quark flavor mixing (\textit{Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa}, or short CKM). The values within this matrix must be determined experimentally, as there is no underlying theory predicting them.

% \subsection{Neutrino mass}
% By observing solar neutrino oscillations, the SNO experiment also established the fact that neutrinos have mass -- contradicting the standard model of particle physics. Only massive particles allow osciallation between flavor eigenstates and mass eigenstates. It does therefore not make sense to ask for the mass of e.g. an electron neutrino, as this flavor eigenstate is a superposition of different mass states. One can speak of the \textit{effective} electron neutrino mass, though; this is defined as

% \begin{equation}
% m_\nu = \sqrt{ \Sigma_i |U_{ei}|^2 m_i^2 }
% \end{equation}
% where $U$ is the PMNS matrix describing the neutrino state mixing. If one could take individual mass measurements of the electron neutrino, one would measure the mass $m_i$ with probability $|U_{ei}|^2$.

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{theory/mass_history.pdf}
%     \caption[Neutrino mass upper limit history]{The history of upper limits on the neutrino mass. From \cite{Aker2022}.}
%     \labfig{mass_history}
% \end{marginfigure}

% Neutrino oscillations are only sensitive to the squared mass differences between the three mass states. One way to measure the average proper neutrino mass is the close inspection of the beta-decay\sidenote{See Section \ref{neutrino_hypothesis}.} spectrum. The most recent experiment to determine neutrino masses, the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino Experiment (KATRIN) uses the beta decay of tritium. If the neutrino were massless, the energy spectrum of the emitted electron would extend up to the total energy of the decay (\SI{18.6}{\eV}). If the neutrino mass is higher, the electron energy can never exceed the energy of that neutrino mass. Note that in principle one could obtain all three neutrino masses from such an experiment, but with current technology, one cannot resolve them. The latest upper limit from KATRIN on the neutrino mass is $m_\nu < \SI{0.8}{\eV}$ at the \SI{90}{\percent} confidence level \sidecite{Aker2022}.


% \subsection{Current understanding} \label{neutrinos_current}
% Modern understanding knows three flavors of neutrinos, which are superposition of three mass states. Their mass is small, but exists. Neutrinos have neither electromagnetic, nor color charge, but a weak hypercharge. This weak hypercharge makes them partake in weak interactions, which are mediated by exchanging $W$ or $Z$ bosons. Fig. \ref{fig:neutrino_interactions} details some possible interaction channels, all constituting deep inelastic scattering with the quarks contained in nucleons, which is the dominant interaction mode for high-energy neutrinos with energies starting from several \unit{\giga\eV} in a medium.

% \begin{figure}[htb]
%     \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{theory/neutrino_interactions_feynman_short.pdf}
%     \caption[Neutrino interactions]{Different neutrino interaction channels for deep inelastic scattering. \textit{Left}: interaction of neutrinos (antineutrinos) with quarks by exchange of a $W^{\pm}$ boson, \textit{right} interaction of neutrinos of all types by exchange of a $Z$ boson. The interaction on the right is called \textit{neutral current} (NC) interaction, while the one on the left is dubbed \textit{charged current} (CC) interaction.}
%     \labfig{neutrino_interactions}
% \end{figure}

% Interactions that involve electromagnetically charged $W^-$ bosons are called \textit{charged current} (CC) interactions, while those involving neutral $Z$ bosons are called \textit{neutral current} (NC) interactions. The beta decay of a neutron into a proton e.g. is a charged current interaction.

% The cross section for neutrinos with matter significantly increases with energy, as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:high_energy_nu_xsec}.

% \section{Low-Energy Neutrino Astronomy}

% \subsection{Stellar neutrinos}
% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{theory/solar_neutrinos.pdf}
%     \caption[Predicted solar neutrino flux]{Predicted solar neutrino flux. From \cite{Agostini2018}.}
%     \labfig{solar_neutrino_flux} 
% \end{marginfigure}

% Low-energy neutrinos, i.e. those carrying energies up to $\mathcal{O}(\unit{\mega\eV})$, are produced in stellar fusion processes and in supernovae. The primary stellar fusion process we can study is of course the sun.

% As already mentioned above, the neutrinos from the sun stem from two processes: The $pp$ chain and the CNO cycle. Within the $pp$ chain, neutrinos get produced by the proton-neutron conversion preceding the fusion of $p+n$ to $^2 \text{H}$. This conversion either happens via the $\beta^+$ decay $p \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e$, resulting in a continuous neutrino spectrum (red curve in Fig. \ref{fig:solar_neutrino_flux}), or via electron capture $e^- + p \rightarrow n + \nu_e$, which results in a line spectrum (leftmost blue line).

% Fig. \ref{fig:solar_neutrino_flux} gives an overview of the predicted solar neutrino spectrum, which is composed of different channels. Towards \unit{\mega\eV} energies, the solar neutrino flux is dominated by the decay of $^8\text{B}\rightarrow ~^8\text{Be} + e^+ + \nu_e$ (green curve) happening in one of the subsequent evolutions of the $pp$ chain. This particular process does not contribute much to the radiative energy output of the sun, but it was the responsible mechanism for the solar neutrino flux of which $2/3$ were missing, constituting the aforementioned solar neutrino puzzle.

% As can be seen in the figure, only low-energy neutrinos are expected from the sun.

% \subsection{Supernovae} \label{sne}
% Only with the first extragalactic neutrino source the era of neutrino astronomy truly began. This source was SN1987a, a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that occured in February 1987.

% Since Kepler's supernova almost 500 years ago\sidenote{A type Ia supernova (see below) that occured in 1604 in the Milky Way}, SN1987a was the first supernova observable by naked eye alone\sidenote{With a brightness of 3-4 mag!}. This was possible as its host galaxy, the LMC, is very close by (\SI{\sim50}{\kilo\parsec})\sidecite{Spurio2018}. SN1987a was the core-collapse of Sanduleak-69202, a blue supergiant, resulting in a type IIP supernova \sidecite{Utrobin2021}. After the optical detection of the source, and following a hint by John Bahcall, the teams of the neutrino detectors Kamiokande-II, Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) and the Baksan Neutrino Observatory (BNO) found a burst of neutrinos predating the light from the supernova by 3 hours \sidecite{Hirata1987,Bionta1987}.

% In total, 25 neutrinos were detected by the three instruments (had IceCube already been operational in 1987, it would have detected \num{\sim13000} neutrinos \sidecite{Halzen2017}). These rates were in agreement with theoretical models for core-collapse supernovae, assuming that \SI{99}{\percent} of the supernova energy is released in the form of neutrinos.

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{theory/sn1987a_flux.pdf}
%     \caption[Neutrinos from SN1987a]{The neutrinos from SN1987a, as measured by Kamiokande-II, IMB and BNO (Baksan). Fig. adapted \cite{Grupen2005}.}
%     \labfig{sn1987a_flux}
% \end{marginfigure}

% Historically, supernovae were classified according to the presence of lines in their spectra. SNe of type I are lacking hydrogen lines in their spectra, in contrast to type II SNe that show hydrogen lines. SNe are further subdivided into SNe Ia that display silicon lines, SNe Ib that do not display silicon lines, but helium lines, and SNe Ic that have neither.

% SNe Ia are a class sui generis. Their underlying physical scenario is a white dwarf accreting matter from a companion star. The accretion eventually causes the star's mass to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of $\sim 1.4~M_\odot$ at which gravitational force overcomes the electron degeneracy pressure, and the star begins to burn carbon due to the higher density. At one point, a runaway thermonuclear reaction starts, and the white dwarf blows up violently \sidecite{Maguire2017}. As the Chandrasekhar limit is the same everywhere, the luminosity of that explosion is to first order the same for all SNe Ia, making them excellent instruments to measure cosmological distances. They are not expected to produce large quantities of neutrinos, though \sidecite{Alsabti2017}.

% \begin{figure}[htb]
%     \includegraphics{theory/ccsn.pdf}
%     \caption[Core-collapse supernova]{Schematic of a core-collapse supernova. Fusion stops in the core (b), causing it to collapse until neutron degeneracy prevents further collapse. A proto neutron star forms in the center (c). The infalling material bounces back from the degeneracy border and forms a shock front (d). The stalling shock is revigorated by the intense flux of neutrinos from the proto neutron star (e) and expands outwards (f). Adapted from \url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Core_collapse_scenario.png} (which is most likely adapted from \cite{Janka2012}).}
%     \labfig{ccsn_schematic}
% \end{figure}

% In contrast to SNe Ia, all other types of SNe are so-called \textit{core-collapse} supernovae (CCSNe).
% Stars generate energy by first buring hydrogen. When a massive star has exhausted its hydrogen, fusion subsides and the gravitational pull compresses it further, until temperatures suitable for helium buring are reached. This process repeats for most of the iron group elements (Fe, Co, Ni).

% A CCSN happens when a star exceeding $8~M_\odot$ has reached its final fusion stage, the fusion of silicon to iron. Iron has the highest binding energy of all elements, therefore fusing iron to heavier elements would release no energy, and the fusion chain stops. With the fusion subsided, the radiation pressure that so far prevented the star from collapsing in on itself stops. The infalling material compresses the core of the star. As soon as the core becomes incompressible due to neutron degeneracy pressure described by the Pauli exlusion principle, the infalling material bounces back from the incompressible core and blows into space. The remaining neutron star in the center either survives, or the infalling material eventually causes it to overcome neutrino degeneracy pressure and collapses it into a black hole \cite{Alsabti2017}.

% The spectral differences between SNe types Ib, Ic and Ii can be explained by the presence or absence of the two outermost shells: hydrogen and helium (see Fig. \ref{fig:sn_shells}). If both shells are already far away from the star, the SN is of type Ic (neither H nor He lines are present in the spectrum). If only the helium shell remains, the type is Ib, and if both shells are still present, the collapse will result in a type II supernova.

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{theory/sn_shells.pdf}
%     \caption[CCSN shells]{CCSN shells. The presence or absence of helium and hydrogen shells explains the differences in the respective spectra of CCSNe type Ib, Ic and II.}
%     \labfig{sn_shells} 
% \end{marginfigure}

% In the centers of these, neutron stars with masses of $1.5-2~M_\odot$ are created. These need to release large amounts of gravitational binding energy during their creation. Because the environment at the center of the CCSN is dense and optically thick, photons are unable to escape: They immediately produce electron-positron pairs, which in turn are quickly absorbed by the surrounding matter.

% Instead, \SI{99}{\percent} of the binding energy is carried away by neutrinos (see panels (e) and (f) in Fig. \ref{fig:ccsn_schematic}). The energy radiated by the nascent neutron star via neutrinos typically amounts to \SI{\sim1.5e53}{\erg}, distributed equally over all three families, with a typical energy carried per neutrino of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\mega\eV})$ \sidecite{Lunardini2017}. 

% It has to be noted though that the exact mechanism the neutrinos play in the SN explosion is still insufficiently understood, as one has to rely on data from one observation only, as well as numerical models. Eventually, a CCSN within our galaxy might come to the rescue \sidecite{Janka2017}.

% \section{Cosmic Rays}
% As the production mechanisms for cosmic rays and high-energy neutrinos are intricately linked, a few words need to be said about the former.

% Cosmic rays were discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess. At the time, it had already been discovered that electroscopes -- devices measuring electric charge and voltage -- sometimes suddenly discharged. This was attributed to particles ionizing the air in the vessel, making it conductive and therefore allowing it to discharge. This was corroborated by the fact that reduced air pressure would slow the speed of the discharge. Another hint was that when shielding the isolated vessel, the ionization would decrease. The source of these ionizing particles was unknown, though.

% Hess measured the flux of ionizing radiation with three electrometers during several balloon journeys. In total, he carried out 10 balloon ascents in the time period of 1911--1913. The first ascent over \SI{5}{\km} in August 1912 marked the discovery of cosmic rays, when he registered a 16-fold increase in ionization measured by the electrometers at that height. Hess consequently concluded that the ionizing radiation must be of extra-terrestrial origin. \sidecite{Steinmaurer1985}.

% \subsection{Composition and energy spectrum}
% More than 100 years later, we know that this ionizing radiation consists of particles, spanning a broad range of energies. These particles are mostly protons, but all stable charged particles and nuclei with lifetimes of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{e6}{\year})$ can be found; most prominently protons, electrons, helium, but also e.g. carbon, oxygen and iron \sidecite{Workman2022}.

% As can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:cr_spectrum}, the cosmic ray spectrum spans a wide range of energies, from a few \unit{\mega\eV} up to \SI{e21}{\eV}, with the higher end of the energy spectrum constituting \textit{Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays} (UHECR).

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{theory/cr_spectrum.pdf}
%     \caption[Cosmic ray spectrum]{Cosmic ray spectrum, as seen by a range of experiments. From \cite{Hillas2006}.}
%     \labfig{cr_spectrum} 
% \end{marginfigure}

% The UHECR part of the spectrum is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:uhecr_spectrum}. It can be described by a series of power laws with different spectral indices, i.e. $E^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ being the spectral index. The UHECR spectrum shows several interesting features, dubbed the \textit{knee}, the anatomically challenging \textit{second knee}, and the \textit{ankle}. These are the points where the spectral index changes, and which are possibly associated with a transition to a new source class, e.g. from galactic to extragalactic sources around the ankle (see \sidecite{Taylor2016}). This is still an active field of research \cite{Workman2022}.

% If high-energy neutrinos are produced in the processes responsible for the creation of cosmic rays (see below), the neutrinos stemming from cosmic rays with energies higher than the ankle should be mainly produced by extragalactic sources \sidecite{Halzen2006}.

% \begin{figure}[htb]

%     \labfig{uhecr_spectrum} 
% \end{figure}

% Identifying the sources of UHECR remains a challenge. As the cosmic ray particles are charged, they are deflected by magnetic fields encountered on their way to Earth, obscuring their origin. What \textit{is} known though is that their extremely high energies necessitate extreme environments in which they can be produced.



% In the 1980s, Hillas proposed the requirement that the efficient acceleration of a charged particle needs an accelerator that is able confine the particle during acceleration: This means that the source needs to be larger than the particle's Larmor radius \sidecite{Rieger2022}. This introduces a bound on the possible sources for UHECR cosmic ray sources:

% \begin{equation}
%     E \leq 10^{20} Z \bigg(\frac{B}{\SI{10}{\micro\gauss}}\bigg) \bigg(\frac{R}{\SI{10}{\kilo\parsec}} \bigg)~\unit{\eV},
% \end{equation}

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{theory/uhecr_hillas_criterion.pdf}
%     \caption[Hillas source distribution]{Possible sources for \SI{e20}{\eV} cosmic rays, as a function of source radius $R$ and the magnetic field strength $B$ of the source. Adapted from \cite{Rieger2022}, original `Hillas plot' in \cite{Hillas1984}.}
%     \labfig{uhecr_hillas_criterion} 
% \end{marginfigure}

% where $Z$ is the cosmic ray particle charge number, $B$ is the magnetic field strength of the source, and $R$ is the characteristic source dimension \cite{Rieger2022}. Sources that match this criterion for the production of UHECR protons and iron nuclei with an energy of \SI{e20}{\eV} are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:uhecr_hillas_criterion}. As one can see, a variety of extreme environments are possible sources of UHECR, some of these also hot candidates for the production of high-energy neutrinos. 

% \subsection{Diffusive shock acceleration} \label{dsa}
% There is a variety of acceleration mechanisms for UHECR. An important process, \textit{diffusive shock acceleration} (DSA), was introduced in the late 1970s. DSA is thought to occur in the presence of shocks that occur e.g. in core-collapse supernovae\sidenote{See Section \ref{sne}}. DSA requires shocks, and shocks require that matter, for example in the form of a plasma, moves with supersonic speed through a surrounding medium.

% To understand DSA, one has to differentiate between an \textit{upstream} region in front of the moving shock front, and a \textit{downstream} region behind the shock front. Consider a shock front moving with a velocity $\vec{v_s}$ through a medium as seen in the observer's rest frame (red line in Fig. \ref{fig:dsa}). If we switch to the rest frame of the shock front, it encounters the upstream medium as flowing towards it with speed $\vec{u_u}=-\vec{v_s}$. Downstream, behind the shock, the velocity of material $u_d$ will be lower: Mass convervation requires that $\rho_u u_u = \rho_d u_d$. In astrophysical shocks containing a fully ionized plasma, the compression ratio $R=\rho_d/\rho_u$ can be as high as 4 \sidecite{Longair2011}. Because $R=u_d/u_u$, the velocity of material downstream (behind the shock front) $u_d$ will then only be $1/4 u_u$.

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{theory/dsa.pdf}
%     \caption[Diffusive shock acceleration]{Sketch illustrating diffusive shock acceleration. A shock front is moving with velocity $v_s$ with respect to an upstream medium. A test particle crosses the shock front twice, each time gaining energy. The length of the arrows are proportional to the velocity.}
%     \labfig{dsa} 
% \end{marginfigure}

% Now consider some test particles upstream, ahead of the shock front rushing towards it. Within a frame of reference in which the upstream gas is at rest, their velocity distribution will be isotropic. Assume that the diffusion on both sides of the shock front is mediated via collisionless processes. This means that momentum and energy transfers between particles are mediated elastically by magnetic irregularities in the plasma (and Coulomb scattering can be neglected). When a test particle eventually with initial velocity $v_1$ (blue arrow in Fig. \ref{fig:dsa}) crosses the shock front to the downstream region, it will see a plasma rushing towards it with speed $w=|u_u-u_d| = (1-0.25)~u_u$, which equals 3/4 of the shock front velocity $v_s$. 

% In the downstream region, they will again be scattered collisionlessly, and receive a small net energy gain of $\big\langle\frac{\Delta E}{E}\big\rangle = \frac{2}{3}\frac{w}{c}$ (see below). This energy gain results in a higher velocity $v_2$. After some time, the particle might cross the shock front again, this time into the upstream region. From the now isotropized particle's frame, the upstream region will again rush in with $0.75~v_s$, and the process repeats, resulting in another gain in energy, and a higher $v_3$ \sidecite{Urosevic2019}, with an average round-trip energy gain of $\big\langle\frac{\Delta E}{E}\big\rangle = \frac{4}{3}\frac{w}{c}$

% We still need to motivate $\big\langle\frac{\Delta E}{E}\big\rangle = \frac{4}{3}\frac{w}{c}$. This can be explained as follows: First, one needs to switch to the test particle frame, i.e. perform a Lorentz transformation. The energy of the test particle will be:

% \begin{marginfigure}
%     \includegraphics{theory/dsa_mc.pdf}
%     \caption[DSA Monte Carlo]{Monte Carlo simulation of a test particle near the shock front. The particle position wildly varies (solid line), but its velocity $v_i$ (dotted line) increases each time it crosses the shock front at $x=0$. Adapted from \cite{Baring1997}}
%     \labfig{dsa_mc} 
% \end{marginfigure}

% \begin{equation}
%     E' = \gamma_{w}(E+p_x w),
% \end{equation}

% where x is the coordinate perpendicular to the shock. The shock is non-relativistic ($w<<c$ and $\gamma_w\approx1$), but the test particles are, so $E\approx pc$ and $p_x \approx E/c \cos(\theta)$. From this it follows that

% \begin{equation}
%     \Delta E = E' - E = E+\frac{E}{c}w\cos{\theta}-E = pw\cos{\theta}
% \end{equation}

% and

% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\Delta E}{E} = \frac{p}{w}\cos{\theta} = \frac{w}{c}\cos{\theta}
%     \label{eqn:delta_e_over_e}
% \end{equation}

% The probability of the test particle angle $\theta$ to lie between $\theta$ and $\theta + \text{d}\theta$ is proportial to $\sin{\theta}\text{d}\theta$, and the test particle approach rate is proportial to $v_x = \frac{p_x}{m} = \frac{E/c\cos{\theta}}{E/c^2} = c \cos{\theta}$. The probability of the test particle crossing the shock front is therefore proportional to $\sin{\theta} \cos{\theta} \text{d}\theta$. The integral from 0 to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ is 0.5, so we need to multiply by 2 to normalize the cumulative probability to 1:

% \begin{equation}
%     p(\theta) = 2\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta} \text{d}\theta
% \end{equation}

% By integrating $p(\theta)$ and using Eqn. \ref{eqn:delta_e_over_e}, we can calculate the average energy gain of each shock crossing:

% \begin{equation}
%     \bigg\langle \frac{\Delta E}{E} \bigg\rangle = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\Delta E}{E} p(\theta) = \frac{w}{c} \int_0^{\pi/2} 2 \sin{\theta} \cos^2{\theta}  \text{d}\theta = \frac{2}{3}\frac{w}{c}
% \end{equation}

% After another crossing, the test particle will gain another average energy increase of $\frac{2}{3}\frac{w}{c}$, resulting in an average energy gain of $\frac{4}{3}\frac{w}{c}$ per round trip \cite{Longair2011}.

% During each crossing, a particle with initial energy $E_0$ will gain an energy fraction $\beta$, resulting in energy $E=\beta E_0$. If $P$ denotes the probability that a particle \textit{stays} within the accelerating region, the number of particles after $k$ crossings can be written as $N=N_0 P^k $, and they will have energies $E=E_0\beta^k$.

% If one solves both equations for $k$ and sets them equal, one obtains
% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{\ln (N/N_0)}{\ln (E/E_0)} = \frac{\ln P}{\ln \beta}.
% \end{equation}

% By rearranging we get

% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{N}{N_0} = \bigg(\frac{E}{E_0}\bigg)^{\ln P / \ln \beta}
% \end{equation}

% To obtain the differential energy spectrum, we differentiate with respect to $E$ and get

% \begin{equation}
% \label{eqn:diff_e_spec}
%     N(E)~\text{d} E = C\times E^{(\ln P/\ln\beta)-1}~\text{d} E
% \end{equation}

% The result is a power law with index $\frac{\ln P}{\ln \beta}$, which is indeed what was already stipulated by experimental data.

% We already know that $\big\langle\frac{\Delta E}{E}\big\rangle = \frac{4}{3}\frac{w}{c}$. With this, $\beta = \frac{E}{E_0} = 1 + \frac{4}{3}\frac{w}{c}$. What is missing is an expression for $P$. To obtain this, we need to estimate the rate at which particles drop out of the system or are `swept away'. As argued by \cite{Longair2011} (and originally presented by \sidecite{Bell1978}), the average number of particles crossing the shock is $\frac{1}{4} n c$, with $n$ being the particle number density. This is true in both directions up- and downstream. The difference though is that downstream particles are `advected' away from the shock further downstream and out of the system, as they are isotropic in that frame. The dropout rate is $n w=\frac{1}{4}nv_s$. From this it follows that the fraction of particles lost (per unit time) is $\frac{1}{4} n v_s/\frac{1}{4}nc = v_s/c$. The survival probability $P$ is thus $P=(1-v_s/c)$. 

% With that, we can compute 
% \begin{equation}
%     \ln P = \ln ( 1-\frac{v_s}{c}) \simeq -\frac{v_s}{c},
% \end{equation}
% and 
% \begin{equation}
%    \ln \beta = \ln(1+\frac{4}{3}\frac{w}{c}) \simeq \frac{4}{3}\frac{w}{c} = \frac{v_s}{c}.
% \end{equation}
% This gives us $\frac{\ln P}{\ln \beta} \simeq -1$. Inserting this into Eq. \ref{eqn:diff_e_spec} yields
% \begin{equation}
%     N(E)~\text{d} E \propto E^{-2}~\text{d} E.
% \end{equation}
% Therefore, the resulting differential energy spectrum has a spectral index of 2. This somewhat differs from the experimentally found spectral index of 2.7 up to the knee. This can be explained by the fact there are several assumptions at play here: The shock is assumed to be non-relativistic, in an ideal gas and constant escape probability. Inefficiencies in the shock, and the inclusion of shock-amplified magnetic fields can both harden the spectral index \cite{Spurio2018}.

% \subsection{Interaction and neutrino production} \label{cr_interactions}
% As discussed above, cosmic rays are most likely produced in astrophysical shocks, as this can explain the power-law structure of the energy distribution. The particles accelerated within shocks might now interact with either hadrons, or photons in their vicinity or on their way to Earth. For simplicity, this section focuses on the interaction of cosmic ray protons, but it applies to heavier nuclei as well.

% \textbf{$pp$ interactions} When cosmic ray protons encounter gas, either at the source location or while crossing the universe, they can interact with this gas, here assumed to consist of protons only for simplicity. The resulting $pp$ interactions produces lots of unstable hadrons, which decay. Those decays are dominated by pion production. Ignoring all secondary hadrons $X$ (which can also decay via pions), possible decay channels of these pions are:

% \begin{eqnarray}
%      \pi^\pm + X &\contour{black}{$\rightarrow$}& \mu^\pm + \nu_\mu (\bar{\nu}_\mu)~~~ \contour{black}{$\rightarrow$} ~~~ e^\pm + \nu_e(\bar{\nu}_e) + \bar{\nu}_\mu(\nu_\mu)\\
%      \pi^0 + X &\contour{black}{$\rightarrow$}& 2\gamma
%  \end{eqnarray} 
% As can be seen, $\pi^\pm$ decay into positive (negative) muons and a muon (anti-)neutrino. Those muons will decay into electrons (positrons), electron (anti-)neutrinos and muon (anti-)neutrinos. The decay of the neutral $\pi^0$ does not generate neutrinos. For pion decays, an average neutrino flavor content of $\nu_e$:$\nu_\mu$:$\nu_\tau = 1:2:0$ is expected. Neutrino oscillation on the way to Earth washes out this initial difference, with an expected flavor content of $1:1:1$ \cite{Workman2022}.

% The energy of the pion decay products is expected to trace the initial proton energy spectrum. If the proton interaction rate is fairly independent of their energy, then they will lose a fraction of their energy, which will then be converted into the production of pions, and subsequently muons. With this, the resulting neutrino spectrum is expected to have a similar shape as the initial cosmic ray spectrum. \todo{warum?, ergänzen, source}

% \textbf{$p\gamma$ interactions}
% Cosmic ray protons can also interact with radiation fields. The cross section for these interactions is large near the $\Delta^+$ resonance. The dominant $\Delta^+$ decay modes again contain pions:
% \begin{eqnarray}
%     \Delta^+ ~~ &\contour{black}{$\rightarrow$}& n + \pi^+ \\
%     \Delta^+ ~~ &\contour{black}{$\rightarrow$}& p + \pi^0
% \end{eqnarray}
% The pions will again decay according to the channels already discussed for $pp$ interactions. The secondary neutrons might decay via beta decay, and produce electron antineutrinos. Also here, the neutrino spectrum is expected to trace the cosmic ray spectrum.\todo{source}


% \section{High-Energy Neutrino Astronomy}
% \subsection{Interacting supernovae} \label{interacting_sne}
% As already detailed in Section \ref{sne}, CCSNe are thought to produce copious amounts of \unit{\mega\eV}-neutrinos. Interestingly, certain types of CCSNe are thought not only to produce such comparably low-energy neutrinos, but also \unit{\tera\eV} neutrinos. Optical observations have stipulated that supernova progenitors often violently eject material into the circumstellar region in the years to centuries prior to their explosion \sidecite{Ofek2014}. When the supernova happens, ejecta are driven into this circumstellar material (CSM).

% SNe of type IIn are a subclass first stipulated by Schlegel \sidecite{Schlegel1990}: The Balmer emission features of early IIn spectra, most prominently the $H_\alpha$ region, show narrow lines on top of a broad component \sidecite{Taddia2013}. The broad component is caused by the supernova itself, but the narrow lines result from interaction of the SN blast-wave with the CSM. This process photo-ionizes the CSM, which results in narrow hydrogen lines.

% Such a system might be promising for the production of high-energy neutrinos, as highlighted in \sidecite{Kurahashi2022}. When the SN ejecta -- expanding with velocities of \SIrange{3000}{10000}{\km\per\s} -- hit the CSM, a shock wave starts to propagate through it. Particle acceleration within the shock is predicted to happen at the moment of \textit{shock breakout}. This is the time when the optical depths of the shock drops below $\approx c/v$, with $v$ being the shock velocity. As soon as the radiation can escape, the shock is no longer radiation-mediated, and protons can be accelerated to high energies \sidecite{Waxman2017}. This emission seizes after the shock decelerates or reaches the outer edge of the CSM. 

% These accelerated protons are expected to generate high-energy neutrinos, either by $pp$ or $p\gamma$ interactions (for details on those interactions, see Section \ref{cr_interactions}). The resulting neutrinos are expected to range from \unit{\giga\eV} to hundreds of \unit{\tera\eV}, reaching their maximum flux shortly after shock breakout \sidecite{Petropoulou2017,Murase2018}.

% The signature of such an event is expected to be a high-energy neutrino detected close the optical peak of a supernova that shows signs of CSM interaction, i.e. narrow lines in the optical spectrum.
% \todo{check, more content}

% \subsection{Gamma-ray bursts}
% Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) were discovered by accident by the \textit{Vela} satellites designed to monitor nuclear detonations as part of a partial test ban treaty between the US and the USSR in the 1960s. 16 bursts of high-energy photon events recorded by those satellites were published in 1973. This kicked off a flurry of research, as a terrestrial or solar origin of these gamma-ray bursts could be excluded \sidecite{Klebesadel1973}.

% The light curves of the very bright and brief events last from a few milliseconds to tens, sometimes hundreds of seconds \sidecite{Vedrenne2009}. As more and more GRBs were registered, a bimodal population was recognized: \textit{Short GRBs} (SGRBs), with an average duration of $\SI{\sim 0.3}{\s}$, and \textit{long GRBs} (LGRBs) that typically last \SIrange{10}{20}{\s}.

% The most prevalent interpretation of these two populations is that short GRBs stem from the merger of two compact objects, e.g. neutron stars. This hypothesized for long, and found spectacular confirmation with the association of the short gamma-ray burst GRB170817A detected \SI{1.7}{\s} after a gravitational wave signal was detected from the same region (GW170817), most likely stemming from the merger of two neutron stars \sidecite{Abbott2017}.

% Meanwhile, long GRBs are hypothesized to be the signatures of jets launched by CCSNe \sidecite{Galama1998}. The existence of such jets has been proposed already in the 1970s; see e.g. \sidecite{Leblanc1970}. If these jets manage to punch through the stellar envelope and the surrounding CSM, one can detect them as long GRBs.

% Both short and long GRBs have been proposed as potential sources of high-energy neutrinos. For short GRBs, these are only attributable to a source if a GRB afterglow is detected, i.e. longer lasting X-ray, optical and radio emission \sidecite{Waxman1997}. The event signature as accessible by IceCube and ZTF (see next two chapters) would be a prompt high-energy neutrino, accompanied by quickly fading optical emission.

%     \labfig{grb_model} 
% \end{figure}

% Long GRBs on the other hand are also predicted to produce high-energy neutrinos. One needs to distinguis three different scenarios, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:grb_model}: If the jet launched by the stellar collapse fails to penetrate the stellar and CSM environment (`choked jet', \textit{left} panel), no light would be visible, only `orphan' neutrinos without counterpart. If the choked jet manages to trigger a shock breakout (see Section \ref{interacting_sne}), both initial neutrinos and delayed neutrinos accompanied by a low-luminosity GRB and afterglow emission would be visible (\textit{middle} panel). If the jet successfully launches, a long GRB is detected (\textit{right} panel). In the optical bands, a young supernova would emerge, rising over the next days and trailing the neutrino detection time, as the latter are expected in the `prompt' phase within minutes after the stellar collapse \sidecite{Senno2016}.

% \subsection{Active galactic nuclei}
% Another extreme environment are active galactic nuclei (AGN). At the center of most galaxies lies a supermassive black hole (SMBH). If the region around the SMBH is active, i.e. bright and/or varying over time, this is considered an AGN.

% The history of experimental AGN research started in 1963, when Maarten Schmidt discovered the a point-like object (3C 273) with a redshift of 0.158, using the P200 on Mount Palomar (see Chapter \ref{ztf}). The large redshift ruled out that the source was a regular star. Rather, it was located in the nucleus of a galaxy with the same redshift. The inferred luminosity was about 100 times brighter than comparable galaxies \sidecite{Schmidt1963}.

\chapter{The IceCube Detector} \label{ic}
\labch{IceCube}
One of the two most relevant instruments for this thesis is the \textit{IceCube Detector}, a neutrino detector located at the geographic South Pole. It is the successor to the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) at the same location \sidecite{Andres1999, Andres2000}.

    \caption[Cherenkov radiation]{The principle of Cherenkov radiation. In the upper figure Cherenkov radiation is emitted at the Cherenkov angle $\theta_\text{C}$, as the radiation emitted at different points in time forms a mutual, cone-shaped wavefront. In the figure on the bottom, all radiation is cancelled out by destructive interference (all circles are subsets of the first on the left, as the particle is not moving faster than light in the medium).

    \labfig{cherenkov}
\end{marginfigure}
The basic operational principle of IceCube (and already of AMANDA) is the detection of Cherenkov light within the Antarctic ice. When charged secondary particles created by neutrino interactions travel through the ice with an energy high enough, their speed can exceed the phase velocity of light in ice and they emit Cherenkov radiation. The detector consists of 5160 individual Digital Optical Modules (DOMs), buried deep in the ice and sensitive to the Cherenkov radiation.

\section{Cherenkov radiation} \label{cherenkov_radiation}

Cherenkov radiation was first detected in 1934 by Soviet scientist Pavel Cherenkov \sidecite{Cherenkov1934}. It occurs when charged particles travel within a medium with a velocity exceeding the speed of light in that very medium. The refractive index in a medium is defined as $n=\frac{c_0}{c_m}$, where $c_0$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $c_m$ is the phase velocity of light in that medium. Note that the phase velocity of light in a medium can exceed $c_0$, so $n<1$ is possible. 

When charged particles cross an electrically neutral dielectric medium, atoms along the particle's path are briefly polarized. When they relax back to the ground state, the atoms emit electromagnetic radiation.

For non-relativistic particles, this radiation destructively interferes with itself, canceling out all signals (see the bottom panel of Fig. \ref{fig:cherenkov}). But if the particle is traveling faster than the speed of light within the medium $c_m$, this destructive interference does not happen. Rather, a cone-shaped wavefront gets created (see top panel of Fig. \ref{fig:cherenkov}). This wavefront constitutes Cherenkov radiation. If the particle has speed $v=\beta c_0$, the angle $\theta$ between the particle trajectory and the direction of the Cherenkov radiation can be calculated as \sidecite{LAnnunziata2020}

\begin{equation}
\cos{\theta} = \frac{\beta}{n}.
\end{equation}

If the medium is ice, to first order the refractive index $n$ is $\approx1.31$.\sidenote{This is of course rather crude. The $n$ of Antarctic glacial ice depends e.g. on depth; a fact we will come back to later when discussing directional reconstruction of high-energy IceCube neutrinos.} A secondary muon traveling through the ice at $0.999\,c_0$ will therefore emit Cherenkov light at an angle of $\theta = \cos^{-1}{\big(\frac{0.999}{1.31}\big)} \approx \SI{40}{\degree}$. 
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic/ic_cherenkov_spectrum.pdf}
    \caption[Cherenkov spectrum]{Cherenkov spectrum for a particle with $v=0.8 \,c_0$ in water. The intensity peaks at $\SI{4e15}{\Hz}$, corresponding to a wavelength of \SI{75}{\nm}, lying at the high-frequency end of the UV spectrum. Adapted from \cite{Fulop1992}.}
    \labfig{cherenkov_spectrum}
\end{marginfigure}
Cherenkov radiation has a smooth, continuous spectrum, with a relative intensity proportional to the frequency. Note that the refractive index of a medium also depends on the frequency, dropping below 1 in the X-ray. From this it follows that Cherenkov radiation appears blue to the human eye (the high-frequency part dominates) and its intensity peaks in the Ultra Violet (UV), before it sharply drops off in the X-ray regime \sidecite{Fulop1992}, see Fig. \ref{fig:cherenkov_spectrum}.

\section{Instrumentation}

IceCube detects neutrinos by observing the optical part of their secondary particle Cherenkov spectrum (see Section \ref{cherenkov_radiation} above). To understand how this is done, one first needs to look at the working principe of a Photomultiplier Tube (PMT), the basic instrument within the DOMs.

\subsection{Photomultiplier tubes}
A PMT is a device used to detect very faint light signals by amplifying them. They consist of vacuum tubes and were successfully realized for the first time in the 1930s \sidecite{Iams1935}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics{ic/ic_pmt_annotated.pdf}
    \caption[PMT schematic]{A photomultiplier tube. Adapted from \cite{Bednarski2014}.}
    \labfig{pmt}

As one can see in Fig. \ref{fig:pmt}, there are three principal components: a \textit{cathode}, a number of \textit{dynodes} and an \textit{anode}. When photons hit the cathode, they can release electrons via the photoelectric effect \sidecite{Einstein1905}. These photoelectrons are then accelerated (towards the right side in Fig. \ref{fig:pmt}) by an electric field within the tube. This field is generated by applying a high voltage between the cathode and the anode.

To amplify the signal, a number of \textit{dynodes} are placed between cathode and anode. These are additional electrodes with subsequently higher voltages. When the photoelectron hits the first dynode, a number of secondary electrons are generated, which are then accelerated towards the next dynode by the electric field. This process repeats for every dynode, generating an avalanche of electrons exponentially amplifying the original single photoelectron signal. The number of secondary electrons hitting the anode is proportional to the number of incident photons, resulting in a linear detector response (as long as the detector stays below its saturation limit) \sidecite{Wright2017}.

IceCube uses PMTs made by Hamamatsu Photonics (R7081-02), sensitive to photons between \SI{300}{\nm} and \SI{650}{\nm}. They have a quantum efficiency (QE) at \SI{390}{\nm} of \SI{25}{\percent}, are operated with a voltage of \SI{1500}{\V} and have a gain (electron multiplication factor) of \num{e7}. The photon-sensitive surface area is typically \SI{530}{\cm\squared} \sidecite{Abbasi2010}.

\subsection{The Digital Optical Module} \label{DOM}
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic/ic_DOM.pdf}
    \caption[IceCube digital optical module]{The IceCube DOM seen from the side. The detecting side of the PMT is facing downwards, with the main board and the PMT base board on top. From \cite{Aartsen2017}.}
    \labfig{ic_dom}
\end{marginfigure}

The individual IceCube PMTs for detecting the Cherenkov radiation are enclosed in the DOMs. Each DOM consists of a pressure-resistant glass sphere, several controller boards and the PMT, facing downward (see Fig. \ref{fig:ic_dom}). The glass sphere can withstand long-term pressure of \SI{250}{\bar}. The optical transmission of the spheres was measured to be \SI{93}{\percent} at \SI{400}{\nm}, decreasing to \SI{10}{\percent} at \SI{315}{\nm}.

The circular main board hosts data acquisition and control, as well as units for communication and a power converter. Another board interfaces with the PMT, while additional boards delay the PMT signals and generate the high voltage current powering the PMT. Additionally, there is a so-called `Flasher Board' that controls Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs). These are used to generate light flashes which can be received by neighboring DOMs for calibration purposes \sidecite{Aartsen2017}.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic/ic_DOM_connections.pdf}
    \caption[IceCube DOM connections]{Connection scheme for four IceCube DOMs along one string. Pairs of DOMs share one twisted-pair cable. Also, each DOM is directly connected to its direct neighbors above and below. Adapted from \cite{Aartsen2017}.} 
    \labfig{ic_dom_connections}
\end{marginfigure}

Because of data storage restrictions, the DOMs only record and digitize the photon signal after several triggering criteria have been met. The digitized voltage over time detected by the PMTs is called a waveform, and it is combined with the timestamp in the basic datum in IceCube, a \textit{hit}.

A hit is triggered when DOMs above and below the DOM in question (the neighbors and the next-to-nearest neighbors) report a coincident signal above a certain threshold\todo{put numbers in} \cite{Aartsen2017}. To fully record the waveform after a hit, there needs to be some kind of buffer. This is realized with the delay board, which routes the analog PMT signal through a \SI{10}{\m} long, serpentine copper trace to delay it by \SI{75}{\ns}.

The digitization of the PMT waveform is done with the Analog Transient Waveform Digitizer (ATWD), a custom-built Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Usually lying dormant, the ATWDs start to capture the delayed waveform when the PMT discriminator initiates it. The captured waveforms are only digitized in case a hit (i.e. local coincidence) is registered \sidecite{Abbasi2013}.

The DOMs are connected to the IceCube Laboratory (ICL) with twisted-pair copper cables. The power for the DOM is also transmitted with this cable. Two DOMs share one twisted-pair cable, and each DOM is also directly connected to its two neighbors on the same string. Fig. \ref{fig:ic_dom_connections} shows the connection layout.

The flasher board houses 12 LEDs operating at \SI{\sim400}{\nm} wavelength. These are used to verify the DOM timing response, to measure the DOM in-ice position, to determine the optical properties of the ice, and to verify the reconstruction algorithms \cite{Aartsen2017}.

\subsection{Detector layout}
In total, approximately 5800 DOM units were built and tested, 300 failing tests and the rest being delivered to the South Pole. The vast majority of these were ultimately deployed (5160 in total). The final detector layout (since the last drilling campaign 2010/2011, see below) consists of 86 strings. The DOMs were deployed along those strings, like pearls on a necklace. Each string contains 60 DOMs, with an average horizontal spacing between strings of \SI{125}{\meter} \cite{Aartsen2017}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=1.\textwidth]{ic/ic_side_view_font.pdf}
    \caption[IceCube side-on]{Side view of the IceCube detector, showing the instrumented array deep in the Antarctic glacial ice. In the center on top is the IceCube Laboratory, were data processing takes place. From \cite{Ahlers2018a}.}
    \labfig{ic_sideon}
\end{figure}
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic/ic_top_view.pdf}
    \caption[IceCube top-down view]{Top-down view of the IceCube detector, spanning \SI{1}{\square\km} on the surface. From \cite{Ahlers2018a}.}
    \labfig{ic_top_down}
\end{marginfigure}

The instrumented part of the strings starts at \SI{1450}{\m} below surface, with one DOM every \SI{17}{\m} to a depth of \SI{2450}{\m}, just above the bedrock at a depth of \SI{2820}{\m}. In Fig. \ref{fig:ic_sideon} the layout of the in-ice array can be seen. The strings follow a roughly hexagonal layout (see Fig. \ref{fig:ic_top_down}), with a side length of \SI{1}{\km\squared}. The total instrumented volume of glacial ice is thus \SI{1}{\km\cubed} \cite{Aartsen2017}. Of the 5160 deployed DOMs, 92 are dead as of March 2023, a loss of \SI{1.7}{\percent}\sidenote{This is better than the predicted failure percentage, which was projected to be \SI{2}{\percent} by 2023 \cite{Aartsen2017}.}.

One can see in Fig. \ref{fig:ic_top_down} that there is a region in the center of the detector which is more densely instrumented: The strings are closer to each other, and also the spacing between DOMs on these strings is reduced from \SI{17}{\m} to \SIrange{7}{10}{\m}. This part of the detector is \textit{DeepCore}, designed to have a lower energy threshold of \SI{10}{\GeV}. The DOMs within DeepCore are also modified for this goal, as they are equipped with PMTs that have a \SI{35}{\percent} higher QE compared to the `normal' DOMs \cite{Aartsen2017}. 


\subsection{Deployment} 
As one can imagine, embedding the DOMs within the ice was a non-trivial task. It required drilling 86 boreholes with a diameter\sidenote{The hole diameter was larger than the DOM diameter (\SI{35}{\cm}) to account for partial refreezing of the bore hole.} of roughly \SI{60}{\cm} and a length of \SI{2500}{\m}. This was achieved over several drilling campaigns with the Enhanced Hot Water Drill (EHWD) specifically built for this task. This drill had a total power of \SI{5}{\mega\W} and was able to drill with a maximum speed of \SI{2.2}{\meter\per\minute}. With these performance characteristics, one hole was drilled every \SI{48}{\hour} on average\sidenote{Drill operation happened around the clock.} \cite{Aartsen2017}. It took 7 drilling seasons to deploy the final IceCube86 setup, from the Antarctic summers 2004/2005 to 2010/2011. Fig. \ref{fig:ic_drill} shows the tower operations site directly above the bore hole \sidecite{Benson2014}.

The water for drilling the holes was heated to \SI{88}{\celsius} with 35 water heaters working in parallel, each providing \SI{125}{\kilo\W} power. The average amount of fuel used per drill hole was \SI{27000}{\liter} \cite{Benson2014}.

    \labfig{ic_drill}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The IceTop surface array}
As IceCube is sensitive to particles moving fast through the ice, there is a variety of background events (see Section \ref{background}). One the major contributors are cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, as the muons generated in these are indiscernible from neutrino-induced muons within the in-ice array (see Section \ref{background}). IceTop serves as a partial veto against cosmic-ray muons and neutrinos, as it is sensitive to the airshowers from which they stem.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic/ic_icetop.pdf}
    \caption[IceTop detector]{IceTop surface Cherenkov detector tank. From \cite{Abbasi2013}.}
    \labfig{ic_icetop}
\end{marginfigure}

The IceTop surface array consists of $2\times81$ ice-filled Cherenkov tanks. These are placed in pairs on the same hexagonal grid as the DOM strings for the in-ice array. Each tank is equipped with two standard IceCube DOMs (see Section \ref{DOM}) \cite{Abbasi2013}, operated at two different gain levels to increase the dynamic range.\todo{more detail}

The array is sensitive to \sidecite{Aartsen2013a}.

\subsection{Data acquisition}\label{data_acquisition}
As noted above, only for locally coincident hits in multiple detectors the full waveforms are digitized by the DOMs. These are then sent to the IceCube Laboratory on the surface via the twisted-pair cable datalink, were all DOM data is ingested into the data acquisition system (DAQ). Hits throughout the detector are investigated by the system to establish common causility by temporal and sometimes spatial patterns. All hits for which common causality can be established form an \textit{event}. The rate of these events varies seasonally with the atmospheric muon flux, with a median event rate of \SI{2.7}{\kilo\Hz} and a total data rate of \SI{1}{\tera\byte\per\day} (roughly \SI{100}{\mega\bit\per\second}) \cite{Aartsen2017}.

Satellite bandwidth is limited and costly. Therefore, further software triggers on-site reduce the data rate to \SI{15}{\percent} of the initial rate. These events are then transmitted via satellite to the IceCube data center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for further analysis. The full event stream is also written to redundant disks, which are transferred twice per year to Madison.

\subsection{Time synchronization}
Precise timing information is crucial to reconstruct an event (see Section \ref{reconstruction}). For this reason, all DOMs need to be synced to a common clock. This is achieved by syncing the whole system to a Symmetricom ET6000 GPS receiver. The synchronization of individual DOMs is performed once per second, while data transfer is paused during the process\sidenote{The calibration sequence takes $\lesssim$\SI{1.3}{\milli\second}} \sidecite{Abbasi2009}.

IceCube ensures temporal synchronizity with an algorithm called Reciprocal Active Pulsing (\texttt{RAPcal}): A bipolar pulse is initiated on the surface and sent to the DOM. The sender saves the local time when it sends the pulse and starts a timer. Upon reception down the string, the DOM also saves its current local time, saves the received pulse waveform, starts a timer, responds with a bipolar pulse of its own and stops the timer. Upon reception, the surface station stops its timer and requests the received pulse waveform and all timing information from the DOM.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic/ic_cascade.png}

    \labfig{ic_cascade}
\end{marginfigure}
With these six pieces of information -- the two transmit timestamps, the two receive timestamps and both waveforms -- a transformation from the GPS-synchronized surface to local DOM time domain and vice versa can be calculated, with a precision of \SIrange{1}{2}{\ns} \cite{Abbasi2009}.

\section{Angular Reconstruction}\label{reconstruction}

The goal of IceCube reconstruction is twofold: Reconstructing the deposited neutrino energy, and reconstructing the neutrino arrival direction. With this in mind, one can sort the events seen by the detector broadly into two categories: Well localized \textit{track events} with poorly reconstructed energy, and \textit{cascade events} with well-determined energy, but very imprecise origin.

\subsection{Event types}

Track events (Fig. \ref{fig:ic_track}) are produced by secondary muons resulting from the charged-current interaction of muon neutrinos with Antarctic glacial ice\sidenote{See section \ref{neutrinos_current}.}. The secondary muons leave tracks in the ice with a length on the order of kilometers. Muons with energies above \SI{\sim 300}{\giga\eV} create tracks that exceed the detector length. In general, this allows for a good angular resolution, ranging from \SI{1}{\degree} for a \SI{1}{\TeV} muon to \SI{0.3}{\degree} for a \SI{1}{\peta\eV} muon \sidecite{Abbasi2022}. The drawback is a large energy uncertainty\todo{energy resolution of 0.25 log $E_\mu$ of the muon energy $E_\mu$ (and quote the energy reconstruction paper)}, as parts of the high-energy muon tracks lie outside the instrumented volume \sidecite{Aartsen2017a}.

Cascade events (Fig. \ref{fig:ic_cascade}) on the other hand are initiated by the charged-current interactions of $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\tau$, as well as by neutral-current interactions from neutrinos of all flavors. They are usually relatively isotropic and contained within the detector, as typical track lengths are of $\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\meter})$. Their relative isotropicity only allows for poor angular resolution (\SIrange{10}{15}{\degree}), but comparably good energy reconstruction ($\frac{\delta E}{E} \approx \SI{15}{\percent}$) \cite{Aartsen2017a}.

As this thesis is concerned with the sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and the angular resolution of track events allows for a better pointing accuracy compared to cascade events, the next section will focus on the angular reconstruction of the former.

\subsection{Likelihood approach}
The main angular reconstruction algorithm for muon tracks used in IceCube is based on the work done for AMANDA. It employs a maximum-likelihood method \sidecite{Ahrens2004}. This can be understood as follows: Given a set set of unknown track parameters $\vec{a}$ and a set of experimentally determined values $\vec{x}$, what values of the unknown parameters do maximize the probability of measuring the actually observed values of $\vec{x}$?

This likelihood is denoted $\mathcal{L}(\vec{x}|\vec{a})$. If the components $x_i$ of $\vec{x}$ are independent, it can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\vec{x}|\vec{a}) = \prod_i p(x_i|\vec{a}).
\end{equation}

Here, $p(x_i|\vec{a})$ is the probability density function (PDF) of measuring $x_i$ given a set of parameters $\vec{a}$. The reconstruction consists in obtaining the set of unknown track parameters $\vec{a}$ that maximizes the likelihood $\mathcal{L}$ (or, for technical reason, minimizes $-\log{\mathcal{L}}$).

% Maximizing $\mathcal{L}$ when varying $\vec{a}$ (or, for technical reasons, minimizing $-\log{\mathcal{L}}$) results in the most likely set of unknown parameters $\vec{a}$, and we are done with the reconstruction.

\subsection{Parametrization}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ic/amanda_reco.pdf}
    \caption[Angular reconstruction in IceCube]{Parametrization for the angular muon reconstruction. Adapted from \cite{Ahrens2004}.}
    \labfig{ic_reco_cherenkov}
\end{figure}

To simplify matters, we assume that we are dealing with a muon with maximum allowed speed ($\beta=1$), traveling along a track of infinite length. Furthermore, we neglect stochastic photon losses\todo{explain stochastic photon losses}. The set of parameters $\vec{a}$ needed to describe the physical situation in the detector are visualized in Fig. \ref{fig:ic_reco_cherenkov}: $\vec{a}$ = ($t_0$, $E_0$, $\vec{r_0}$, $\vec{p}$). They describe the trajectory of a muon located at position $\vec{r_0}$ with energy $E_0$ at time $t_0$, and traveling in the direction $\vec{p}$

So we are dealing with one time parameter, one energy parameter and positional parameters in 5 dimensions, where the vertex position $\vec{r}_0$ can be expressed in (x,y,z) and the muon direction $\vec{p}$ is usually described by two angles, zenith and azimuth\sidenote{The zenith angle is the angle to a line vertical to the Earth, centered on the detector surface and pointing southwards. An azimuth angle of \SI{90}{\degree} describes a particle traveling from North (prime meridian pointing towards Greenwich) to South, while a particle with an azimuth angle of \SI{0}{\degree} travels from the 90th Meridian East to West.}. In the context of IceCube muon reconstruction, this parameter set $\vec{a}$ is known as the \textit{track hypothesis}.

Now, a DOM in the detector at position $\vec{r}_i$ at a distance $d$ to the track can be hit by Cherenkov photons emitted by the muon traveling along the track with the Cherenkov angle $\theta_\text{C}$, arriving at an angle $\eta$ with respect to the PMT axis. Without scattering, the photon reaches the $\text{DOM}_i$ at the geometrical time $t_\text{geo}$, which can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
t_\text{geo} = t_0 + \frac{|\vec{p}\cdot(\vec{r_i}-\vec{r_0})|+d\cdot \tan{\theta_\text{C}}}{c_0},
\end{equation}

with $c_0$ the vacuum speed of light. As this does not take scattering into account, it is useful to define a relative time of arrival, the \textit{time residual} $t_\text{res} = t_\text{hit} - t_\text{geo}$. This is the additional time introduced by scattering as opposed to a Cherenkov photon traveling directly from the muon to the DOM.

As the position of the DOM is known, $t_\text{res}$ is the most significant observable for each DOM,  We therefore simplify $x_i$ to $t_{\text{res},i}$, and express $\vec{a}$ as a function of the individual DOM parameters: $\vec{a}= (d_i,\eta_i,...)$, where $\eta_i$ is the angle to the DOM PMT axis (see Fig. \ref{fig:ic_reco_cherenkov}).


\subsection{First (single) photoelectron fit}
Matters can be simplified further. While the muon is traveling and emitting Cherenkov light, multiple photons can hit each DOM. One simplification is to only regard the \textit{first} photon hitting an individual DOM, as it is usually less scattered than the average photon. If the reconstruction is using this simplification, it is called \textit{single photoelectron} (SPE) fit. The likelihood function for this is\sidenote{As stated above, this already includes the reduction of $x_i$ to $t_{\text{res},i}$.}

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_\text{1st}(\vec{x}|\vec{a}) = \prod_i^\text{1st hits} p(t_{\text{res},i}|\vec{a}=d_i, \eta_i,...),
\end{equation}

where the probability density function $p(t_{\text{res},i}|\vec{a})$ is obtained from simulations modeling the photon propagation through the Antarctic ice (this is necessary because the photon scatter needs to be accounted for). The simulation results are either stored in look-up tables or approximated by analytical functions \cite{Ahrens2004}. 

\subsection{Multi photoelectron fit}
A complication is that one expects the first photon in a DOM detecting multiple photons \textit{earlier} than a photon detected by a DOM only registering a single photon. This is because more photon hits mean that the DOM is closer to the event, and therefore receives a higher signal -- which means that the event is detected earlier. 

This leads to the \textit{multi photoelectron} (MPE) fit. Here, the single photon part of the likelihood is modified by the cumulative PDF (CDF), which is given by\todo{explain!!}

\begin{equation}
P(t_{\text{res},i}|\vec{a}) = \int^{\infty}_{t_{\text{res},i}}p(t|\vec{a})\,dt.
\end{equation}

Using this, the MPE likelihood is given as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_\text{MPE} = \prod_i^\text{1st hits} p(t_{\text{res},i}|\vec{a}) \cdot N_i \cdot (1-P(t_{\text{res},i}|\vec{a})^{N_i-1},
\end{equation}

where $N_i$ is the total number of photons recorded by $\text{DOM}_i$ \cite{Ahrens2004}.\todo{Transition missing.}

\subsection{\texttt{Millipede} reconstruction} \label{millipede}
High-energy neutrino events that pass the realtime alert selection criteria (see Section \ref{ic_alert_program}) are sujected to a more sophisticated algorithm, which uses the information from all the detected photons. This algorithm is dubbed \texttt{Millipede}. Due to its demand of computational resources it is only run for selected events at the IceCube data center in Madison.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{ic/ic_millipede_IC221124A.pdf}
    \caption[\texttt{Millipede} reconstruction of IC221124A]{\texttt{Millipede} reconstruction of IC221124A.}
    \labfig{ic_millipede}
\end{marginfigure}

This reconstruction consists of a maximum likelihood scan covering the whole sky. To allow scanning, the sky is pixelated into grids of increasing resolution following the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation (\texttt{HEALPix}) scheme \sidecite{Gorski2005}. Each pixel of a specific resolution covers the same area on the sky. For each scanned pixel, the muon direction is fixed to originate from that sky location.

For this fixed direction, the likelihood of the deposited energy resulting from the best fit and the neutrino interaction vertex in the detector are then computed. Pixels near the likelihood maximum are then subdivided with a finer \texttt{HEALPix} resolution. This procedure ultimately results in a likelihood map of the sky, with increasing granularity towards the global maximum \sidecite{Abbasi2023}.

To compute the \SI{50}{\percent} and \SI{90}{\percent} confidence level uncertainty contours, Monte Carlo re-simulations from the high-energy neutrino event IC160427A are used. For this event, Pan-STARRS found a possible counterpart, PS16cgx\sidenote{Spectroscopic follow up reveiled that this event was either a SN Ic, which would be compatible with neutrino production, or -- more likely -- a SN Ia, which would exclude it as a neutrino source.} \sidecite{Kankare2019}.

In the re-simulations, the systematic parameters of the Antarctic ice used to model photon propagation were varied. Additionally, the simulated direction and energies were varied, with cuts to ensure that the light deposition of the resimulations resembled the original event (\SI{\pm 2}{\degree} in direction, \SI{\pm 20}{\percent} in deposited charge).

Each re-simulated event was fit with \texttt{Millipede}. The distribution of differences between the best-fit likelihood and the ground truth of the simulated event can then be employed to convert the change in log-likelihood over the map into a confidence level.

Currently, all pixels that satisfy $\log \mathcal{L}_\text{min}-\log \mathcal{L}_\text{pixel} = -11.3$ $(-32.1)$ form the \SI{50}{\percent} (\SI{90}{\percent}) error contours \sidecite{Gualda2021}. In Fig. \ref{fig:ic_millipede} these contours are displayed for an example event. The black line shows the \SI{50}{\percent} uncertainty region, while the red line shows the \SI{90}{\percent} area.
\todo{Cristina ergänzung}
% I would explain that Wilks' theorem doesn't apply here due to the systematic uncertainties, and the contours that one would derive from it are scaled up with the IC160427A values. Maybe also add that this doesn't really give the correct coverage on individual alerts (that's what is discussed in my proceedings as well)

\section{Sensitivity} \label{ic_sensitivity}
IceCube: Sensitivity (It detects neutrinos with energies ranging from 1010 to 1016 eV)

\section{The Realtime Alert Program}\label{ic_alert_program}
Since 2016, IceCube is hosting a realtime alert program, providing the astrophysical community with low-latency, high-quality astrophysical neutrino alerts \cite{Aartsen2017a}. This program saw a major revision in 2019, when two new alert streams, namely \textit{Gold} and \textit{Bronze}, were created \sidecite{Blaufuss2019}. As all alerts used within this work except one stem from this revised system, I will focus on presenting the newer alert scheme.

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ic/ic_muon_free_path.pdf}
    \caption[Muon free path in ice]{Free path length for \SI{1}{\peta\eV} muons in ice. The mean free path in ice is slightly longer than in rock. From \cite{Chirkin2004}.}
    \labfig{ic_muon_free_path}
\end{marginfigure}

When searching for the sources of astrophysical neutrinos, there are two major sources of background events in the IceCube detector. Both stem from secondary cosmic-ray particles from the Earth's atmosphere.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{ic/ic_background.pdf}
    \caption[Background events]{Background events in the detector. Cosmic rays hit the atmosphere around the globe and produce muons (solid blue arrows), as well as neutrinos (dashed blue arrows). When constraining to \textit{up-going} events from the northern hemisphere, the detector is shielded from atmospheric muons, but not atmospheric neutrinos, as these can traverse the Earth. Adapted from \cite{Ahlers2018a}.}
    \labfig{ic_background}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Atmospheric muons} are created by cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere. One can efficiently filter this background by restricting the analysis to \textit{up-going} muon tracks. These are tracks that come from the bottom of the detector, i.e. the northern hemisphere. Atmospheric muons stemming from cosmic-ray events in the northern hemisphere are filtered out by the Earth's core (see Fig. \ref{fig:ic_background}), as the mean free path of muons within the Earth is much smaller \sidecite{Chirkin2004} than the distance they have to cross (see Fig. \ref{fig:ic_muon_free_path}). Note that due to light scattering within the ice, some down-going tracks can be misclassified as up-going \sidecite{Ahlers2018a}.

One complication here stems from the fact that the Earth starts to become opaque for neutrinos of higher energies. Studies interested in \si{\peta\eV} neutrinos therefore must deal with the fact that these get the more suppressed the longer their path through the Earth is. For example, a \SI{1}{\peta\eV} neutrino with a zenith angle of \SI{140}{\degree} is absorbed with \SI{90}{\percent} probability \sidecite{Aartsen2017c}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ic/ic_absorption_earth.pdf}
    \caption[Neutrino absorption in the Earth]{Neutrino transmission probability through the Earth. The longer the distance traveled (higher zenith angles) and the higher the neutrino energy, the more likely is absorption. From \cite{Aartsen2017c}.}

\end{figure}
\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{ic/ic_HESE_veto.pdf}

    \labfig{ic_hese_veto}
\end{marginfigure}

\textbf{Atmospheric neutrinos} also stem from cosmic-ray induced air showers. These cannot be suppressed by directional cuts, creating an irreducible background: When atmospheric neutrinos cross the Earth and interact with the matter close to the detector, they can produce muons indistinguishable from muons created by `proper' cosmic neutrinos \cite{Ahlers2018a}.

\subsection{Event selection} \label{ic_event_selection}

Gold and Bronze alerts are drawn from three different selection schemes, originally designed to cater to different science goals. These are \textbf{High Energy Starting Events} (HESE) \sidecite{Abbasi2021}, \textbf{Extremely High Energy} (EHE) events \sidecite{Aartsen2016} and \textbf{Gamma-Ray Follow Up} (GFU) events \sidecite{gfu2016}.

\textbf{HESE} are events that start \textit{within} the detector. This is guaranteed by using the outer regions of the detector as a veto region, in which (almost) no Cherenkov light must be detected \sidecite{Aartsen2013}. The sizes of those regions can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:ic_hese_veto}. The majority of HESE events are cascade-type events and therefore not well suited for observational follow-up due to their poor angular reconstruction. Because of this drawback, additional cuts are applied: At least 6000 photoelectrons are required, and the reconstruction must favor a track interpretation of the event, and the reconstructed track length must be at least \SI{200}{\meter} \cite{Abbasi2023}. Note that the selection criteria used in the Gold and Bronze HESE selection are slightly different than those in the original paper cited above.


\textbf{EHE} aims at neutrino energies of \SIrange{0.5}{10}{\peta\eV}. To reject atmospheric background events, a two-dimensional cut depending on the reconstructed zenith angle and the log of detected photoelectrons is applied. Additionally, a $\chi^2$-based goodness-of-fit cut is applied to select track-like events with good reconstructions \cite{Abbasi2023}.

\textbf{GFU} events are selected based on a boosted decision tree trained to identify \textit{through-going} (as opposed to `starting') track events with astrophysical origin. Energy cuts are applied: Northern hemisphere events are selected based on their reconstructed muon energies, while from the southern hemisphere are selected based on the total photoelectron charge deposited in the detector.

The cuts from all three event pools are gauged to achieve two different average values of \textit{signalness}, which is a proxy for the probability that the event is of astrophysical origin \cite{Abbasi2023}. It is defined as
\begin{definition}\label{signalness_def}
$\text{Signalness}(E,\theta_\text{zen}) = \frac{N_\text{signal}(E,\theta_\text{zen})}{N_\text{signal}(E,\theta_\text{zen})+N_\text{background}(E,\theta_\text{zen})}$
\end{definition}
Here E is the reconstructed neutrino energy, and $N_\text{signal}(E,\theta_\text{zen})$ and $N_\text{background}(E,\theta_\text{zen})$ are the number of signal and background events at zenith angle $\theta_\text{zen}$ above energy $E$ as determined by simulations \cite{Abbasi2023}.

The cuts on the individual event selections are tuned to ensure that \textit{Gold} alerts on average have a signalness $\langle \SI{50}{\percent} \rangle$, and \textit{Bronze} alerts have a signalness $\langle \SI{30}{\percent} \rangle$.

\subsection{Alert distribution} \label{ic_alerts}
All events that pass a first stage of filtering are sent to the IceCube data center (see Section \ref{data_acquisition}) via Iridium satellite to minimize latency. There, their signalness is computed. After this, they are distributed globally with the General Coordinates Network\sidenote{\url{https://gcn.nasa.gov/}} (GCN) in the form of GCN Notices.

Each notices contains the discovery time, a unique event number, the reconstructed direction in right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec) of the candidate neutrino, a statistical error for the direction, the reconstructed neutrino energy, the signalness and the false alarm rate \cite{Blaufuss2019}.

Those information are later appended by \texttt{Millipede}, a computationally more demanding, but more sophisticated reconstruction (see Section \ref{millipede}). The results of these reconstructions (i.e. the angular uncertainty) are typically distributed a few hours after the initial notice in the form of a GCN circular, and an updates GCN notice \cite{Blaufuss2019}.

As of March 2023, a total of 106 events have been distributed in this format, with 7 later being retracted. Since the start of the Gold and Bronze alert stream in June 2019, this amounts to $2.2$ non-retracted alerts per month\sidenote{This is quite close to the 2.5 alerts per month predicted in \cite{Blaufuss2019}.} (0.8 Gold alerts, 1.4 Bronze alerts). For a full list of all high-energy neutrino alerts issued by IceCube, not only those since introduction of the Gold and Bronze format, see \cite{Abbasi2023}.

If the event is most likely astrophysical and reasonably well pin-pointed, one can scan the sky localization with a telescope and look for potential sources of the neutrino. But where to obtain optical information from? The telescope used for this, the Zwicky Transient Facility, will be described in Chapter \ref{ztf}.

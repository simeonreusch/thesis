\chapter{Candidate TDE AT2019fdr: A Possible Source?} \label{at2019fdr}
\labch{AT2019fdr}
AT2019fdr emerged as a candidate when following up the high-energy IceCube neutrino IC200530A. The gold alert\sidenote{See Section \ref{ic_event_selection}} neutrino was detected on May 30, 2020 with a \SI{90}{\percent} rectangular uncertainty area of \SI{25.4}{\square\deg}, a signalness of 0.59 and an estimated neutrino energy of \SI{82.2}{\tera\eV} \cite{IC200530A1}.

Two more sources were inititally published by us as candidate sources (SN2020lls and SN2020lam), but both could be ruled out with follow-up observations. For details on these, see Section \ref{SN2020lls} and \ref{SN2020lam}. This left AT2019fdr as the only remaining neutrino source candidate, a long lived optical transient located at RA $= 257.278575$ and Dec $= +26.855758$, with a distance to the reported neutrino best-fit location of \SI{1.72}{\degree}.

At the moment of neutrino arrival, the transient was already 400 days old. It was originally discovered May 13, 2019 by \textit{AMPEL} \sidecite{at2019fdr_disc}, with a first detection on May 3, 2019. The neutrino arrived about 10 months after the optical peak. The peak flux in the ZTF \textit{g}-band was \SI{1.3e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. The redshift of $z=0.2666$ was inferred from the Balmer lines visible in a spectrum taken on July 3, 2019 with the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the P200. The peak \textit{g}-band luminosity calculated with this redshift, $L_\text{peak}=\SI{2.9e44}{\erg\per\s}$, showed that AT2019fdr was an extraordinarily luminous event\sidenote{Here and in the following I will use a standard flat cosmology with $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$ and $H_0=\SI{70}{\km\per\s\per\mega\parsec}$.}.

The long-duration flare was initially tentatively classified as a superluminous supernova of type IIn (SLSN IIn). A peculiarity of this event is that it occured close to the core of its host galaxy SDSSCGB 6856.2, a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy, a type of AGN. The mean angular separation to the host position as reported in the \textit{Gaia} DR2 was \SI{0.03 \pm 0.15}{\arcsecond}. Due to this proximity, it was systematically followed up by ZTF program dedicated to study flares in NLSy1 galaxies. 

In a paper describing the sample of such flares detected during ZTF Phase I, a \textit{TDE interpretation} of AT2019fdr was stipulated \sidecite{Frederick2021}. The authors outright rejected a SLSN interpretation, and also argued against an AGN origin of the flare. The reasons for disfavoring the SLN hypothesis were the 
long-lived U-band and UV emission, emission at the blue end of the Balmer line profiles, the overall longevity of the flare and it nuclear location close to the center of its host galaxy \cite{Frederick2021}.

\end{figure*}

In the following, I will give an overview over the observations in different wavelengths, the reductions of the near infrared observations triggered by us, modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED), interpretation of the delayed infrared signal as dust echo, revisit the TDE interpretation and calculate the chance of observing an event comparable to AT2019fdr in temporal and spatial coincidence with a high-energy neutrino.

\section{Multi-wavelength Observations}
As AT2019fdr was discovered close to the core of its host galaxy, it was followed up as part of regular ZTF TDE group activities from early on, including ToO observations by \textit{Swift} UVOT and XRT. 

After observing the neutrino, we triggered additional follow up by \textit{Swift} UVOT, requested multi-epoch near-infrared observations with the Wide Field Infrared Camera (WIRC) \sidecite{Wilson2003} on the P200, and triggered multi-epoch radio observations with VLA. 

Furthermore, we analyzed data by the Large Array Telescope (LAT) \sidecite{Atwood2009} aboard the \textit{Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope} (\textit{Fermi}), analyzed four epochs of observations by the Extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) telescope \sidecite{Predehl2021} aboard the \textit{Spectrum Roentgen Gamma} (\textit{SRG}) \sidecite{Sunyaev2021} space mission. 

All detections and upper limits except for the radio data are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_light_curve}. As one can see, the flare was very long lived, with a moderately fast rise (\SI{\sim100}{\day} until optical peak), a short decay phase followed by a plateau, and lastly an exponential decay with a seemingly constant decay rate \sidecite{Reusch2022}.

\subsection{Gamma-ray limits}

\begin{marginfigure}

    \caption[The \textit{Fermi} satellite]{The \textit{Fermi} satellite. Image credit: NASA.}
    \labfig{fermi_satellite}
\end{marginfigure}

The details of the \textit{Fermi} LAT analysis were published in \sidecite{Velzen2021}. The one year long time window analyzed for AT2019fdr spanned from the first optical detection of the source on May 3, 2019, until the arrival of the neutrino on May 30, 2020.

No gamma-ray sources were detected significantly (\SI{\geq 5}{\sigma}), neither new sources nor previously known sources from the 10 year \textit{Fermi} LAT Fourth Source Catalog (4FGL-DR2) \sidecite{Abdollahi2020,Ballet2020}. The \SI{95}{\percent} CL upper limit derived for this time window within the energy bin of \SIrange{0.1}{800}{\giga\eV} is \SI{1e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. This upper limit was calculated by testing a point-source hypothesis at the location of AT2019fdr, assuming a power-law spectrum of the form $\text{d}N/\text{d}E \propto E^{-\Gamma}$, with a spectral index $\Gamma=2$ \cite{Velzen2021}.

\subsection{X-ray observations}
The sky region of AT2019 was visited four times by SRG with a six-month cadence. The first visit was March 13--14, 2020. Only on the third visit the source was detected, which can be counted as evidence for temporal evolution in X-ray wavelengths. All measurements and the upper limits and detections derived from these are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_light_curve} and listed in Table \ref{tab:at2019fdr_erosita}.

\end{table}

The single detection from March 11, 2021 revealed a very soft thermal spectrum. The best-fit blackbody temperature was \SI[parse-numbers = false]{56^{+32}_{-26}}{\eV}, with the errors being \SI{68}{\percent} for one parameter of interest. In the source rest frame, this measurement corresponds to a temperature of \SI[parse-numbers = false]{71^{+41}_{-33}}{\eV}. This renders the X-ray spectrum of AT2019fdr one of the softest spectra of the TDEs discovered by \textit{SRG}/eROSITA so far \sidecite{Sazonov2021}. 

The equivalent hydrogen column density had a best-fit value of $\text{NH}=\SI[parse-numbers = false]{1.47^{+2.80}_{-1.25}\times10^{21}}{\per\square\cm}$. That value is consistent -- within errors -- with the galactic value of $\text{NH}_\text{Gal} = \SI{0.40e21}{\per\square\cm}$. There is some degeneracy between the neutral hydrogen column density and the inferred blackbody temperature; this is usual for soft sources. However, with $T_\text{bb}=\SI{131}{\eV}$ at the \SI{95}{\percent} confidence level, the temperature upper bound is still fairly low \cite{Reusch2022}.

As noted above, \textit{Swift} XRT had already observed AT2019fdr 14 times prior to the neutrino arrival \cite{Frederick2021}. We requested a prompt ToO observation after the source emerged as a neutrino candidate, which was carried out on June 7, 2020 with a \SI{2000}{\s} exposure.

The data was reduced with the publicly available \texttt{Swift XRT data products generator} \sidecite{Centre2020} in the energy range of \SIrange{0.3}{10}{\kilo\eV}. As all 14 observations prior to the neutrino arrival were non-detections, those were binned (total exposure: \SI{20700}{\s}) to compute a \SI{3}{\sigma} energy flux upper limit of \SI{1.4e-13}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. The upper flux limit for the post-neutrino observation was \SI{4.7e-12}{\erg\per\s\per\square\cm}. To convert photon counts to to energy flux, I employed the \texttt{HEASARC WebPIMMS} tool \sidecite{Arida2020}. The blackbody temperature was set to the \SI{56}{\eV} measured by \textit{SRG}/eROSITA, and the best-fit neutral hydrogen column density from the same measurement was used \cite{Reusch2022}.

\subsection{Optical/UV observations}
The ZTF optical observations were processed with \texttt{fpbot}\sidenote{See Section \ref{fpbot}}. The science-ready \textit{Swift} data was retrieved from the \textit{Swift} archive\sidenote{\url{https://www.swift.ac.uk/swift_portal}}. All exposures of individual epochs were co-added, and filtered to boost the signal-to-noise with \texttt{uvotsim}, contained in \texttt{HEAsoft}\sidenote{\url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft}}. The brightness of the transient was measured using \texttt{uvotsource} of the same package. The aperture used was \SI{3}{\arcsecond}, with a far bigger radius used for the background level extraction. We calibrated the photometry with files made available by September 2020 and employed the methods of \sidecite{Breeveld2011} to convert the measured magnitudes to the AB system\sidenote{See Section \ref{magnitudes}}. The extracted and converted magnitudes were then corrected by subtracting the synthetic host model described below \cite{Reusch2022}.

As the extraction of the infrared measurements was more involved due to host-galaxy blending, this will be detailed in a full Section below.

\subsection{Radio observations}
After the neutrino detection, we applied for Director's Discretionary Time (DDT) on the VLA. Three individual measurements were taken on July 3, September 13 and November 7, 2020. The first epoch was carried out in the \SIrange{2}{4}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{8}{12}{\giga\Hz}. In the subsequent epochs, we added the \SIrange{1}{2}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{4}{8}{\giga\Hz} bands. Delay, bandpass and flux calibration were performed on the source 3C 286, and the nearby source J1716+2152 was used for the complex gain calibration. For this, the VLA calibration pipeline in the Common Astrometry Software Application (CASA) \sidecite{Bean2022} was used, and imaging was performed with the CASA task \texttt{tclean}. Finally, the target flux density was measured by fitting a point source in the image plane \cite{Reusch2022}.

\begin{marginfigure}
    \includegraphics{at2019fdr/vla.jpg}
    \caption[VLA]{VLA in New Mexico. Image credit: NSF.}
    \labfig{vla}
\end{marginfigure}

Flux from the source location was measured in all three epochs. At all epochs, the flux density declined with higher frequencies. While epoch 1 and 2 showed no evolution in the \SIrange{4}{8}{\giga\Hz} and \SIrange{8}{12}{\giga\Hz} bands, the final epoch suggested reduced flux and subsequently a spectral steepening in these bands. Intensive testing revealed that the reduced flux was not intrinsic to the source, but rather significant atmospheric phase changes between the calibrator scans. This reduced the measured flux densities during epoch 3 due to decorrelation. As the source flux density was too low for self calibration, the effect could not be corrected for. We concluded that no evidence for temporal evolution in the radio can be found during the 5 months of observation. All measurements are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:at2019fdr_radio} and listed in Table \ref{tab:at2019fdr_radio}.

From \cite{Reusch2022}.}
    \labfig{at2019fdr_radio}
\end{figure}

To compare to pre-flare host radio emission, we also obtained an archival upper limit from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) \sidecite{Lacy2020}. We exclusively used VLASS, as it is the only survey with sufficient sensitivity and angular resolution to probe AT2019fdr. The quicklook continuum \texttt{fits} file for tile T17t23We was obtained from the archive\sidenote{\url{https://archive-new.nrao.edu/vlass/quicklook}}. The observation was carried out on November 25, 2017 in the \SIrange{2}{4}{\giga\Hz} band. At a significance level of \SI{3}{\sigma}, no emission from the source was detected. The local RMS noise was $\sigma=\SI{0.11}{\milli\jansky}/\text{beam}$, and the beam size was $\SI{2.46}{\arcsecond} \times \SI{2.28}{\arcsecond}$ at a position angle of \SI{-37}{\degree}. This results in an upper limit of \SI{0.32}{\milli\jansky}. A second VLASS observation was taken a few days prior to our second trigger epoch, but the resulting \SI{3}{\sigma} upper limit was less constraining (\SI{0.4}{\milli\jansky}) \cite{Reusch2022}.

\section{Near-infrared observations}
After the detection of the neutrino, we triggered near-infrared observations to extend the SED to longer wavelengths. We observed during 4 epochs with WIRC on the Palomar P200 in the \textit{J}-, \textit{H} and \textit{Ks}-band. The dates of observations were July 1 and September 27, 2020, as well as February 2 and May 28, 2021. 

All WIRC measurements were reduced using a custom pipeline (see \sidecite{De2020}), which performs flat fielding, background subtraction and fits an astrometric solution using \textit{Gaia} DR2. Subsequently, the individual images for each filter and epoch were stacked to increase signal-to-noise. The photometric zero-point calibration of the stacked images was achieved within the pipeline by comparison to the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) \sidecite{Skrutskie2006}.

As another galaxy lies close to AT2019fdr's host galaxy\todo{distance}, the flux extraction was done manually with \texttt{GALFIT} \sidecite{Peng2002}. This two-dimensional fitting algorithm allows to define different galactic types and components, as well as point sources, and simultaneously fit the science images with these source types. 

To improve precision, the point spread function\sidenote{See Section \ref{psfphot}} of individual stacked images was first derived with \texttt{photutils} \sidecite{Bradley2020}, a package for the Python astronomy toolkit \texttt{astropy} \sidecite{PriceWhelan2022}. All stars within the surrounding of AT2019fdr were selected for this. From this selection, a subset of star neither too dim nor too bright were visually selected. Using these stars, the PSF of the image was calculated.
